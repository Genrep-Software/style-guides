\section{Background}\label{background}}

This guide is originally copied from the
\href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html}{Google C++
Style Guide}. It was downloaded and converted to Markdown format with
Pandoc, and has since been modified to suit Genrep software development
needs.

C++ is one of the main development languages used by many of Genrep's
open-source projects. As every C++ programmer knows, the language has
many powerful features, but this power brings with it complexity, which
in turn can make code more bug-prone and harder to read and maintain.

The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by describing in
detail the dos and don'ts of writing C++ code . These rules exist to
keep the code base manageable while still allowing coders to use C++
language features productively.

\emph{Style}, also known as readability, is what we call the conventions
that govern our C++ code. The term Style is a bit of a misnomer, since
these conventions cover far more than just source file formatting.

Most open-source projects developed by Genrep conform to the
requirements in this guide.

Note that this guide is not a C++ tutorial: we assume that the reader is
familiar with the language.

\hypertarget{goals-of-the-style-guide}{%
\subsection{Goals of the Style Guide}\label{goals-of-the-style-guide}}

Why do we have this document?

There are a few core goals that we believe this guide should serve.
These are the fundamental \textbf{why}s that underlie all of the
individual rules. By bringing these ideas to the fore, we hope to ground
discussions and make it clearer to our broader community why the rules
are in place and why particular decisions have been made. If you
understand what goals each rule is serving, it should be clearer to
everyone when a rule may be waived (some can be), and what sort of
argument or alternative would be necessary to change a rule in the
guide.

The goals of the style guide as we currently see them are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Style rules should pull their weight The benefit of a style rule must
  be large enough to justify asking all of our engineers to remember it.
  The benefit is measured relative to the codebase we would get without
  the rule, so a rule against a very harmful practice may still have a
  small benefit if people are unlikely to do it anyway. This principle
  mostly explains the rules we don't have, rather than the rules we do:
  for example, \texttt{goto} contravenes many of the following
  principles, but is already vanishingly rare, so the Style Guide
  doesn't discuss it.
\item
  Optimize for the reader, not the writer Our codebase (and most
  individual components submitted to it) is expected to continue for
  quite some time. As a result, more time will be spent reading most of
  our code than writing it. We explicitly choose to optimize for the
  experience of our average software engineer reading, maintaining, and
  debugging code in our codebase rather than ease when writing said
  code. ``Leave a trace for the reader'' is a particularly common
  sub-point of this principle: When something surprising or unusual is
  happening in a snippet of code (for example, transfer of pointer
  ownership), leaving textual hints for the reader at the point of use
  is valuable (\texttt{std::unique\_ptr} demonstrates the ownership
  transfer unambiguously at the call site).
\item
  Be consistent with existing code Using one style consistently through
  our codebase lets us focus on other (more important) issues.
  Consistency also allows for automation: tools that format your code or
  adjust your \texttt{\#include}s only work properly when your code is
  consistent with the expectations of the tooling. In many cases, rules
  that are attributed to ``Be Consistent'' boil down to ``Just pick one
  and stop worrying about it''; the potential value of allowing
  flexibility on these points is outweighed by the cost of having people
  argue over them.
\item
  Be consistent with the broader C++ community when appropriate
  Consistency with the way other organizations use C++ has value for the
  same reasons as consistency within our code base. If a feature in the
  C++ standard solves a problem, or if some idiom is widely known and
  accepted, that's an argument for using it. However, sometimes standard
  features and idioms are flawed, or were just designed without our
  codebase's needs in mind. In those cases (as described below) it's
  appropriate to constrain or ban standard features. In some cases we
  prefer a homegrown or third-party library over a library defined in
  the C++ Standard, either out of perceived superiority or insufficient
  value to transition the codebase to the standard interface.
\item
  Avoid surprising or dangerous constructs C++ has features that are
  more surprising or dangerous than one might think at a glance. Some
  style guide restrictions are in place to prevent falling into these
  pitfalls. There is a high bar for style guide waivers on such
  restrictions, because waiving such rules often directly risks
  compromising program correctness.
\item
  Avoid constructs that our average C++ programmer would find tricky or
  hard to maintain C++ has features that may not be generally
  appropriate because of the complexity they introduce to the code. In
  widely used code, it may be more acceptable to use trickier language
  constructs, because any benefits of more complex implementation are
  multiplied widely by usage, and the cost in understanding the
  complexity does not need to be paid again when working with new
  portions of the codebase. When in doubt, waivers to rules of this type
  can be sought by asking your project leads. This is specifically
  important for our codebase because code ownership and team membership
  changes over time: even if everyone that works with some piece of code
  currently understands it, such understanding is not guaranteed to hold
  a few years from now.
\item
  Be mindful of our scale With a codebase of 100+ million lines and
  thousands of engineers, some mistakes and simplifications for one
  engineer can become costly for many. For instance it's particularly
  important to avoid polluting the global namespace: name collisions
  across a codebase of hundreds of millions of lines are difficult to
  work with and hard to avoid if everyone puts things into the global
  namespace.
\item
  Concede to optimization when necessary Performance optimizations can
  sometimes be necessary and appropriate, even when they conflict with
  the other principles of this document.
\end{itemize}

The intent of this document is to provide maximal guidance with
reasonable restriction. As always, common sense and good taste should
prevail. By this we specifically refer to the established conventions of
the entire Genrep C++ community, not just your personal preferences or
those of your team. Be skeptical about and reluctant to use clever or
unusual constructs: the absence of a prohibition is not the same as a
license to proceed. Use your judgment, and if you are unsure, please
don't hesitate to ask your project leads to get additional input.

\hypertarget{c-version}{%
\section{C++ Version}\label{c-version}}

Currently, code should target C++17, i.e., should not use C++2x
features. The C++ version targeted by this guide will advance
(aggressively) over time.

Do not use \protect\hyperlink{Nonstandard_Extensions}{non-standard
extensions}.

Consider portability to other environments before using features from
C++14 and C++17 in your project.

\hypertarget{header-files}{%
\section{Header Files}\label{header-files}}

In general, every \texttt{.cc} file should have an associated
\texttt{.h} file. There are some common exceptions, such as unit tests
and small \texttt{.cc} files containing just a \texttt{main()} function.

Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to the
readability, size and performance of your code.

The following rules will guide you through the various pitfalls of using
header files.

\protect\hypertarget{The_-inl.h_Files}{}{}

\hypertarget{self-contained-headers}{%
\subsection{Self-contained Headers}\label{self-contained-headers}}

Header files should be self-contained (compile on their own) and end in
\texttt{.h}. Non-header files that are meant for inclusion should end in
\texttt{.inc} and be used sparingly.

All header files should be self-contained. Users and refactoring tools
should not have to adhere to special conditions to include the header.
Specifically, a header should have
\protect\hyperlink{The__define_Guard}{header guards} and include all
other headers it needs.

Prefer placing the definitions for template and inline functions in the
same file as their declarations. The definitions of these constructs
must be included into every \texttt{.cc} file that uses them, or the
program may fail to link in some build configurations. If declarations
and definitions are in different files, including the former should
transitively include the latter. Do not move these definitions to
separately included header files (\texttt{-inl.h}); this practice was
common in the past, but is no longer allowed.

As an exception, a template that is explicitly instantiated for all
relevant sets of template arguments, or that is a private implementation
detail of a class, is allowed to be defined in the one and only
\texttt{.cc} file that instantiates the template.

There are rare cases where a file designed to be included is not
self-contained. These are typically intended to be included at unusual
locations, such as the middle of another file. They might not use
\protect\hyperlink{The__define_Guard}{header guards}, and might not
include their prerequisites. Name such files with the \texttt{.inc}
extension. Use sparingly, and prefer self-contained headers when
possible.

\hypertarget{the-define-guard}{%
\subsection{The \#define Guard}\label{the-define-guard}}

All header files should have \texttt{\#define} guards to prevent
multiple inclusion. The format of the symbol name should be
\texttt{\textless{}PROJECT\textgreater{}\_\textless{}PATH\textgreater{}\_\textless{}FILE\textgreater{}\_H\_}.

To guarantee uniqueness, they should be based on the full path in a
project's source tree. For example, the file \texttt{foo/src/bar/baz.h}
in project \texttt{foo} should have the following guard:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\PreprocessorTok{\#ifndef FOO\_BAR\_BAZ\_H\_}
\PreprocessorTok{\#define FOO\_BAR\_BAZ\_H\_}

\NormalTok{...}

\PreprocessorTok{\#endif  }\CommentTok{// FOO\_BAR\_BAZ\_H\_}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{forward-declarations}{%
\subsection{Forward Declarations}\label{forward-declarations}}

Avoid using forward declarations where possible. Instead,
\texttt{\#include} the headers you need.

A ``forward declaration'' is a declaration of a class, function, or
template without an associated definition.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Forward declarations can save compile time, as \texttt{\#include}s
  force the compiler to open more files and process more input.
\item
  Forward declarations can save on unnecessary recompilation.
  \texttt{\#include}s can force your code to be recompiled more often,
  due to unrelated changes in the header.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Forward declarations can hide a dependency, allowing user code to skip
  necessary recompilation when headers change.
\item
  A forward declaration may be broken by subsequent changes to the
  library. Forward declarations of functions and templates can prevent
  the header owners from making otherwise-compatible changes to their
  APIs, such as widening a parameter type, adding a template parameter
  with a default value, or migrating to a new namespace.
\item
  Forward declaring symbols from namespace \texttt{std::} yields
  undefined behavior.
\item
  It can be difficult to determine whether a forward declaration or a
  full \texttt{\#include} is needed. Replacing an \texttt{\#include}
  with a forward declaration can silently change the meaning of code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// b.h:}
\KeywordTok{struct}\NormalTok{ B \{\};}
\KeywordTok{struct}\NormalTok{ D : B \{\};}

\CommentTok{// good\_user.cc:}
\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{"b.h"}
\DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ f(B*);}
\DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ f(}\DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{*);}
\DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ test(D* x) \{ f(x); \}  }\CommentTok{// calls f(B*)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  If the \texttt{\#include} was replaced with forward decls for
  \texttt{B} and \texttt{D}, \texttt{test()} would call
  \texttt{f(void*)}.
\item
  Forward declaring multiple symbols from a header can be more verbose
  than simply \texttt{\#include}ing the header.
\item
  Structuring code to enable forward declarations (e.g., using pointer
  members instead of object members) can make the code slower and more
  complex.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Try to avoid forward declarations of entities defined in another
  project.
\item
  When using a function declared in a header file, always
  \texttt{\#include} that header.
\item
  When using a class template, prefer to \texttt{\#include} its header
  file.
\end{itemize}

Please see \protect\hyperlink{Names_and_Order_of_Includes}{Names and
Order of Includes} for rules about when to \#include a header.

\hypertarget{inline-functions}{%
\subsection{Inline Functions}\label{inline-functions}}

Define functions inline only when they are small, say, 10 lines or
fewer.

You can declare functions in a way that allows the compiler to expand
them inline rather than calling them through the usual function call
mechanism.

Inlining a function can generate more efficient object code, as long as
the inlined function is small. Feel free to inline accessors and
mutators, and other short, performance-critical functions.

Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower. Depending on a
function's size, inlining it can cause the code size to increase or
decrease. Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease
code size while inlining a very large function can dramatically increase
code size. On modern processors smaller code usually runs faster due to
better use of the instruction cache.

A decent rule of thumb is to not inline a function if it is more than 10
lines long. Beware of destructors, which are often longer than they
appear because of implicit member- and base-destructor calls!

Another useful rule of thumb: it's typically not cost effective to
inline functions with loops or switch statements (unless, in the common
case, the loop or switch statement is never executed).

It is important to know that functions are not always inlined even if
they are declared as such; for example, virtual and recursive functions
are not normally inlined. Usually recursive functions should not be
inline. The main reason for making a virtual function inline is to place
its definition in the class, either for convenience or to document its
behavior, e.g., for accessors and mutators.

\hypertarget{names-and-order-of-includes}{%
\subsection{Names and Order of
Includes}\label{names-and-order-of-includes}}

Include headers in the following order: Related header, C system
headers, C++ standard library headers, other libraries' headers, your
project's headers.

All of a project's header files should be listed as descendants of the
project's source directory without use of UNIX directory aliases
\texttt{.} (the current directory) or \texttt{..} (the parent
directory). For example,
\texttt{google-awesome-project/src/base/logging.h} should be included
as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{"base/logging.h"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In \texttt{dir/foo.cc} or \texttt{dir/foo\_test.cc}, whose main purpose
is to implement or test the stuff in \texttt{dir2/foo2.h}, order your
includes as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{dir2/foo2.h}.
\item
  A blank line
\item
  C system headers (more precisely: headers in angle brackets with the
  \texttt{.h} extension), e.g.,
  \texttt{\textless{}unistd.h\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}stdlib.h\textgreater{}}.
\item
  A blank line
\item
  C++ standard library headers (without file extension), e.g.,
  \texttt{\textless{}algorithm\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}cstddef\textgreater{}}.
\item
  A blank line
\item
  Other libraries' \texttt{.h} files.
\item
  Your project's \texttt{.h} files.
\end{enumerate}

Separate each non-empty group with one blank line.

With the preferred ordering, if the related header \texttt{dir2/foo2.h}
omits any necessary includes, the build of \texttt{dir/foo.cc} or
\texttt{dir/foo\_test.cc} will break. Thus, this rule ensures that build
breaks show up first for the people working on these files, not for
innocent people in other packages.

\texttt{dir/foo.cc} and \texttt{dir2/foo2.h} are usually in the same
directory (e.g., \texttt{base/basictypes\_test.cc} and
\texttt{base/basictypes.h}), but may sometimes be in different
directories too.

Note that the C headers such as \texttt{stddef.h} are essentially
interchangeable with their C++ counterparts (\texttt{cstddef}). Either
style is acceptable, but prefer consistency with existing code.

Within each section the includes should be ordered alphabetically. Note
that older code might not conform to this rule and should be fixed when
convenient.

You should include all the headers that define the symbols you rely
upon, except in the unusual case of
\protect\hyperlink{Forward_Declarations}{forward declaration}. If you
rely on symbols from \texttt{bar.h}, don't count on the fact that you
included \texttt{foo.h} which (currently) includes \texttt{bar.h}:
include \texttt{bar.h} yourself, unless \texttt{foo.h} explicitly
demonstrates its intent to provide you the symbols of \texttt{bar.h}.

For example, the includes in
\texttt{google-awesome-project/src/foo/internal/fooserver.cc} might look
like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{"foo/server/fooserver.h"}

\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{\textless{}sys/types.h\textgreater{}}
\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{\textless{}unistd.h\textgreater{}}

\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{\textless{}string\textgreater{}}
\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{\textless{}vector\textgreater{}}

\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{"base/basictypes.h"}
\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{"base/commandlineflags.h"}
\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{"foo/server/bar.h"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Exception:}

Sometimes, system-specific code needs conditional includes. Such code
can put conditional includes after other includes. Of course, keep your
system-specific code small and localized. Example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{"foo/public/fooserver.h"}

\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{"base/port.h"}\PreprocessorTok{  }\CommentTok{// For LANG\_CXX11.}

\PreprocessorTok{\#ifdef LANG\_CXX11}
\PreprocessorTok{\#include }\ImportTok{\textless{}initializer\_list\textgreater{}}
\PreprocessorTok{\#endif  }\CommentTok{// LANG\_CXX11}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{scoping}{%
\section{Scoping}\label{scoping}}

\hypertarget{namespaces}{%
\subsection{Namespaces}\label{namespaces}}

With few exceptions, place code in a namespace. Namespaces should have
unique names based on the project name, and possibly its path. Do not
use \emph{using-directives} (e.g., \texttt{using\ namespace\ foo}). Do
not use inline namespaces. For unnamed namespaces, see
\protect\hyperlink{Unnamed_Namespaces_and_Static_Variables}{Unnamed
Namespaces and Static Variables}.

Namespaces subdivide the global scope into distinct, named scopes, and
so are useful for preventing name collisions in the global scope.

Namespaces provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large
programs while allowing most code to use reasonably short names.

For example, if two different projects have a class \texttt{Foo} in the
global scope, these symbols may collide at compile time or at runtime.
If each project places their code in a namespace, \texttt{project1::Foo}
and \texttt{project2::Foo} are now distinct symbols that do not collide,
and code within each project's namespace can continue to refer to
\texttt{Foo} without the prefix.

Inline namespaces automatically place their names in the enclosing
scope. Consider the following snippet, for example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{namespace}\NormalTok{ outer \{}
\KeywordTok{inline} \KeywordTok{namespace}\NormalTok{ inner \{}
  \DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ foo();}
\NormalTok{\}  }\CommentTok{// namespace inner}
\NormalTok{\}  }\CommentTok{// namespace outer}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The expressions \texttt{outer::inner::foo()} and \texttt{outer::foo()}
are interchangeable. Inline namespaces are primarily intended for ABI
compatibility across versions.

Namespaces can be confusing, because they complicate the mechanics of
figuring out what definition a name refers to.

Inline namespaces, in particular, can be confusing because names aren't
actually restricted to the namespace where they are declared. They are
only useful as part of some larger versioning policy.

In some contexts, it's necessary to repeatedly refer to symbols by their
fully-qualified names. For deeply-nested namespaces, this can add a lot
of clutter.

Namespaces should be used as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Follow the rules on \protect\hyperlink{Namespace_Names}{Namespace
  Names}.
\item
  Terminate namespaces with comments as shown in the given examples.
\item
  Namespaces wrap the entire source file after includes,
  \href{https://gflags.github.io/gflags/}{gflags}
  definitions/declarations and forward declarations of classes from
  other namespaces.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// In the .h file}
\KeywordTok{namespace}\NormalTok{ mynamespace \{}

\CommentTok{// All declarations are within the namespace scope.}
\CommentTok{// Notice the lack of indentation.}

\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}

\NormalTok{\}  }\CommentTok{// namespace mynamespace}

  More complex \texttt{.cc} files might have additional details, like
  flags or using-declarations.

\item
  To place generated protocol message code in a namespace, use the
  \texttt{package} specifier in the \texttt{.proto} file. See
  \href{https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/cpp-generated\#package}{Protocol
  Buffer Packages} for details.
\item
  Do not declare anything in namespace \texttt{std}, including forward
  declarations of standard library classes. Declaring entities in
  namespace \texttt{std} is undefined behavior, i.e., not portable. To
  declare entities from the standard library, include the appropriate
  header file.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Do not use \emph{Namespace aliases} at namespace scope in header files
  except in explicitly marked internal-only namespaces, because anything
  imported into a namespace in a header file becomes part of the public
  API exported by that file.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{unnamed-namespaces-and-static-variables}{%
\subsection{Unnamed Namespaces and Static
Variables}\label{unnamed-namespaces-and-static-variables}}

When definitions in a \texttt{.cc} file do not need to be referenced
outside that file, place them in an unnamed namespace or declare them
\texttt{static}. Do not use either of these constructs in \texttt{.h}
files.

All declarations can be given internal linkage by placing them in
unnamed namespaces. Functions and variables can also be given internal
linkage by declaring them \texttt{static}. This means that anything
you're declaring can't be accessed from another file. If a different
file declares something with the same name, then the two entities are
completely independent.

Use of internal linkage in \texttt{.cc} files is encouraged for all code
that does not need to be referenced elsewhere. Do not use internal
linkage in \texttt{.h} files.

Format unnamed namespaces like named namespaces. In the terminating
comment, leave the namespace name empty:

\begin{Shaded}

\KeywordTok{namespace}\NormalTok{ \{}
\NormalTok{...}
\NormalTok{\}  }\CommentTok{// namespace}

\hypertarget{nonmember-static-member-and-global-functions}{%
\subsection{Nonmember, Static Member, and Global
Functions}\label{nonmember-static-member-and-global-functions}}

Prefer placing nonmember functions in a namespace; use completely global
functions rarely. Do not use a class simply to group static members.
Static methods of a class should generally be closely related to
instances of the class or the class's static data.

Nonmember and static member functions can be useful in some situations.
Putting nonmember functions in a namespace avoids polluting the global
namespace.

Nonmember and static member functions may make more sense as members of
a new class, especially if they access external resources or have
significant dependencies.

Sometimes it is useful to define a function not bound to a class
instance. Such a function can be either a static member or a nonmember
function. Nonmember functions should not depend on external variables,
and should nearly always exist in a namespace. Do not create classes
only to group static members; this is no different than just giving the
names a common prefix, and such grouping is usually unnecessary anyway.

If you define a nonmember function and it is only needed in its
\texttt{.cc} file, use
\protect\hyperlink{Unnamed_Namespaces_and_Static_Variables}{internal
linkage} to limit its scope.

\hypertarget{local-variables}{%
\subsection{Local Variables}\label{local-variables}}

Place a function's variables in the narrowest scope possible, and
initialize variables in the declaration.

C++ allows you to declare variables anywhere in a function. We encourage
you to declare them in as local a scope as possible, and as close to the
first use as possible. This makes it easier for the reader to find the
declaration and see what type the variable is and what it was
initialized to. In particular, initialization should be used instead of
declaration and assignment, e.g.,:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ i;}
\NormalTok{i = f();      }\CommentTok{// Bad {-}{-} initialization separate from declaration.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ j = g();  }\CommentTok{// Good {-}{-} declaration has initialization.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{vector\textless{}}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{\textgreater{} v;}
\NormalTok{v.push\_back(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{);  }\CommentTok{// Prefer initializing using brace initialization.}
\NormalTok{v.push\_back(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{vector\textless{}}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{\textgreater{} v = \{}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{\};  }\CommentTok{// Good {-}{-} v starts initialized.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Variables needed for \texttt{if}, \texttt{while} and \texttt{for}
statements should normally be declared within those statements, so that
such variables are confined to those scopes. E.g.:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{while}\NormalTok{ (}\AttributeTok{const} \DataTypeTok{char}\NormalTok{* p = strchr(str, }\CharTok{\textquotesingle{}/\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)) str = p + }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There is one caveat: if the variable is an object, its constructor is
invoked every time it enters scope and is created, and its destructor is
invoked every time it goes out of scope.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Inefficient implementation:}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ (}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ i = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; i \textless{} }\DecValTok{1000000}\NormalTok{; ++i) \{}
\NormalTok{  Foo f;  }\CommentTok{// My ctor and dtor get called 1000000 times each.}
\NormalTok{  f.DoSomething(i);}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It may be more efficient to declare such a variable used in a loop
outside that loop:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Foo f;  }\CommentTok{// My ctor and dtor get called once each.}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ (}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ i = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; i \textless{} }\DecValTok{1000000}\NormalTok{; ++i) \{}
\NormalTok{  f.DoSomething(i);}
\NormalTok{\}}

\subsection{Static and Global
Variables}\label{static-and-global-variables}}

Objects with
\href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration\#Storage_duration}{static
storage duration} are forbidden unless they are
\href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_destructible}{trivially
destructible}. Informally this means that the destructor does not do
anything, even taking member and base destructors into account. More
formally it means that the type has no user-defined or virtual
destructor and that all bases and non-static members are trivially
destructible. Static function-local variables may use dynamic
initialization. Use of dynamic initialization for static class member
variables or variables at namespace scope is discouraged, but allowed in
limited circumstances; see below for details.

As a rule of thumb: a global variable satisfies these requirements if
its declaration, considered in isolation, could be \texttt{constexpr}.

Every object has a {storage duration}, which correlates with its
lifetime. Objects with static storage duration live from the point of
their initialization until the end of the program. Such objects appear
as variables at namespace scope (``global variables''), as static data
members of classes, or as function-local variables that are declared
with the \texttt{static} specifier. Function-local static variables are
initialized when control first passes through their declaration; all
other objects with static storage duration are initialized as part of
program start-up. All objects with static storage duration are destroyed
at program exit (which happens before unjoined threads are terminated).

Initialization may be {dynamic}, which means that something non-trivial
happens during initialization. (For example, consider a constructor that
allocates memory, or a variable that is initialized with the current
process ID.) The other kind of initialization is {static}
initialization. The two aren't quite opposites, though: static
initialization \emph{always} happens to objects with static storage
duration (initializing the object either to a given constant or to a
representation consisting of all bytes set to zero), whereas dynamic
initialization happens after that, if required.

Global and static variables are very useful for a large number of
applications: named constants, auxiliary data structures internal to
some translation unit, command-line flags, logging, registration
mechanisms, background infrastructure, etc.

Global and static variables that use dynamic initialization or have
non-trivial destructors create complexity that can easily lead to
hard-to-find bugs. Dynamic initialization is not ordered across
translation units, and neither is destruction (except that destruction
happens in reverse order of initialization). When one initialization
refers to another variable with static storage duration, it is possible
that this causes an object to be accessed before its lifetime has begun
(or after its lifetime has ended). Moreover, when a program starts
threads that are not joined at exit, those threads may attempt to access
objects after their lifetime has ended if their destructor has already
run.

\hypertarget{decision-on-destruction}{%
\subsection{Decision on destruction}\label{decision-on-destruction}}

When destructors are trivial, their execution is not subject to ordering
at all (they are effectively not ``run''); otherwise we are exposed to
the risk of accessing objects after the end of their lifetime.
Therefore, we only allow objects with static storage duration if they
are trivially destructible. Fundamental types (like pointers and
\texttt{int}) are trivially destructible, as are arrays of trivially
destructible types. Note that variables marked with \texttt{constexpr}
are trivially destructible.

\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that references are not objects, and thus they are not subject to
the constraints on destructibility. The constraint on dynamic
initialization still applies, though. In particular, a function-local
static reference of the form \texttt{static\ T\&\ t\ =\ *new\ T;} is
allowed.

\hypertarget{decision-on-initialization}{%
\subsection{Decision on
initialization}\label{decision-on-initialization}}

Initialization is a more complex topic. This is because we must not only
consider whether class constructors execute, but we must also consider
the evaluation of the initializer:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ n = }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{;    }\CommentTok{// fine}
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ m = f();  }\CommentTok{// ? (depends on f)}
\NormalTok{Foo x;        }\CommentTok{// ? (depends on Foo::Foo)}
\NormalTok{Bar y = g();  }\CommentTok{// ? (depends on g and on Bar::Bar)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

All but the first statement expose us to indeterminate initialization
ordering.

The concept we are looking for is called \emph{constant initialization}
in the formal language of the C++ standard. It means that the
initializing expression is a constant expression, and if the object is
initialized by a constructor call, then the constructor must be
specified as \texttt{constexpr}, too:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{struct}\NormalTok{ Foo \{ }\KeywordTok{constexpr}\NormalTok{ Foo(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{) \{\} \};}

\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ n = }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{;  }\CommentTok{// fine, 5 is a constant expression}
\NormalTok{Foo x(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{);   }\CommentTok{// fine, 2 is a constant expression and the chosen constructor is constexpr}
\NormalTok{Foo a[] = \{ Foo(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{), Foo(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{), Foo(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{) \};  }\CommentTok{// fine}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Constant initialization is always allowed. Constant initialization of
static storage duration variables should be marked with
\texttt{constexpr} or where possible the
\href{https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/03c1513538584f4a04d666be5eb469e3979febba/absl/base/attributes.h\#L540}{\texttt{ABSL\_CONST\_INIT}}
attribute. Any non-local static storage duration variable that is not so
marked should be presumed to have dynamic initialization, and reviewed
very carefully.

By contrast, the following initializations are problematic:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Some declarations used below.}
\DataTypeTok{time\_t}\NormalTok{ time(}\DataTypeTok{time\_t}\NormalTok{*);      }\CommentTok{// not constexpr!}
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ f();                   }\CommentTok{// not constexpr!}
\KeywordTok{struct}\NormalTok{ Bar \{ Bar() \{\} \};}

\CommentTok{// Problematic initializations.}
\DataTypeTok{time\_t}\NormalTok{ m = time(}\KeywordTok{nullptr}\NormalTok{);  }\CommentTok{// initializing expression not a constant expression}
\NormalTok{Foo y(f());                }\CommentTok{// ditto}
\NormalTok{Bar b;                     }\CommentTok{// chosen constructor Bar::Bar() not constexpr}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Dynamic initialization of nonlocal variables is discouraged, and in
general it is forbidden. However, we do permit it if no aspect of the
program depends on the sequencing of this initialization with respect to
all other initializations. Under those restrictions, the ordering of the
initialization does not make an observable difference. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ p = getpid();  }\CommentTok{// allowed, as long as no other static variable}
                   \CommentTok{// uses p in its own initialization}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Dynamic initialization of static local variables is allowed (and
common).

\hypertarget{common-patterns}{%
\subsection{Common patterns}\label{common-patterns}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Global strings: if you require a global or static string constant,
  consider using a simple character array, or a char pointer to the
  first element of a string literal. String literals have static storage
  duration already and are usually sufficient.
\item
  Maps, sets, and other dynamic containers: if you require a static,
  fixed collection, such as a set to search against or a lookup table,
  you cannot use the dynamic containers from the standard library as a
  static variable, since they have non-trivial destructors. Instead,
  consider a simple array of trivial types, e.g., an array of arrays of
  ints (for a ``map from int to int''), or an array of pairs (e.g.,
  pairs of \texttt{int} and \texttt{const\ char*}). For small
  collections, linear search is entirely sufficient (and efficient, due
  to memory locality); consider using the facilities from
  \href{https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/algorithm/container.h}{absl/algorithm/container.h}
  for the standard operations. If necessary, keep the collection in
  sorted order and use a binary search algorithm. If you do really
  prefer a dynamic container from the standard library, consider using a
  function-local static pointer, as described below.
\item
  Smart pointers (\texttt{unique\_ptr}, \texttt{shared\_ptr}): smart
  pointers execute cleanup during destruction and are therefore
  forbidden. Consider whether your use case fits into one of the other
  patterns described in this section. One simple solution is to use a
  plain pointer to a dynamically allocated object and never delete it
  (see last item).
\item
  Static variables of custom types: if you require static, constant data
  of a type that you need to define yourself, give the type a trivial
  destructor and a \texttt{constexpr} constructor.
\item
  If all else fails, you can create an object dynamically and never
  delete it by using a function-local static pointer or reference (e.g.,
  \texttt{static\ const\ auto\&\ impl\ =\ *new\ T(args...);}).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{thread_local-variables}{%
\subsection{thread\_local Variables}\label{thread_local-variables}}

\texttt{thread\_local} variables that aren't declared inside a function
must be initialized with a true compile-time constant, and this must be
enforced by using the
\href{https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/attributes.h}{\texttt{ABSL\_CONST\_INIT}}
attribute. Prefer \texttt{thread\_local} over other ways of defining
thread-local data.

Starting with C++11, variables can be declared with the
\texttt{thread\_local} specifier:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\AttributeTok{thread\_local}\NormalTok{ Foo foo = ...;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Such a variable is actually a collection of objects, so that when
different threads access it, they are actually accessing different
objects. \texttt{thread\_local} variables are much like
\protect\hyperlink{Static_and_Global_Variables}{static storage duration
variables} in many respects. For instance, they can be declared at
namespace scope, inside functions, or as static class members, but not
as ordinary class members.

\texttt{thread\_local} variable instances are initialized much like
static variables, except that they must be initialized separately for
each thread, rather than once at program startup. This means that
\texttt{thread\_local} variables declared within a function are safe,
but other \texttt{thread\_local} variables are subject to the same
initialization-order issues as static variables (and more besides).

\texttt{thread\_local} variable instances are destroyed when their
thread terminates, so they do not have the destruction-order issues of
static variables.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Thread-local data is inherently safe from races (because only one
  thread can ordinarily access it), which makes \texttt{thread\_local}
  useful for concurrent programming.
\item
  \texttt{thread\_local} is the only standard-supported way of creating
  thread-local data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Accessing a \texttt{thread\_local} variable may trigger execution of
  an unpredictable and uncontrollable amount of other code.
\item
  \texttt{thread\_local} variables are effectively global variables, and
  have all the drawbacks of global variables other than lack of
  thread-safety.
\item
  The memory consumed by a \texttt{thread\_local} variable scales with
  the number of running threads (in the worst case), which can be quite
  large in a program.
\item
  An ordinary class member cannot be \texttt{thread\_local}.
\item
  \texttt{thread\_local} may not be as efficient as certain compiler
  intrinsics.
\end{itemize}

\texttt{thread\_local} variables inside a function have no safety
concerns, so they can be used without restriction. Note that you can use
a function-scope \texttt{thread\_local} to simulate a class- or
namespace-scope \texttt{thread\_local} by defining a function or static
method that exposes it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Foo\& MyThreadLocalFoo() \{}
  \AttributeTok{thread\_local}\NormalTok{ Foo result = ComplicatedInitialization();}
  \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ result;}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{thread\_local} variables at class or namespace scope must be
initialized with a true compile-time constant (i.e., they must have no
dynamic initialization). To enforce this, \texttt{thread\_local}
variables at class or namespace scope must be annotated with
\href{https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/attributes.h}{\texttt{ABSL\_CONST\_INIT}}
(or \texttt{constexpr}, but that should be rare):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ABSL\_CONST\_INIT }\AttributeTok{thread\_local}\NormalTok{ Foo foo = ...;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{thread\_local} should be preferred over other mechanisms for
defining thread-local data.

follow when writing a class.

\subsection{Doing Work in
Constructors}\label{doing-work-in-constructors}}

Avoid virtual method calls in constructors, and avoid initialization
that can fail if you can't signal an error.

It is possible to perform arbitrary initialization in the body of the
constructor.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No need to worry about whether the class has been initialized or not.
\item
  Objects that are fully initialized by constructor call can be
  \texttt{const} and may also be easier to use with standard containers
  or algorithms.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the work calls virtual functions, these calls will not get
  dispatched to the subclass implementations. Future modification to
  your class can quietly introduce this problem even if your class is
  not currently subclassed, causing much confusion.
\item
  There is no easy way for constructors to signal errors, short of
  crashing the program (not always appropriate) or using exceptions
  (which are \protect\hyperlink{Exceptions}{forbidden}).
\item
  If the work fails, we now have an object whose initialization code
  failed, so it may be an unusual state requiring a
  \texttt{bool\ IsValid()} state checking mechanism (or similar) which
  is easy to forget to call.
\item
  You cannot take the address of a constructor, so whatever work is done
  in the constructor cannot easily be handed off to, for example,
  another thread.
\end{itemize}

Constructors should never call virtual functions. If appropriate for
your code , terminating the program may be an appropriate error handling
response. Otherwise, consider a factory function or \texttt{Init()}
method as described in \href{https://abseil.io/tips/42}{TotW \#42} .
Avoid \texttt{Init()} methods on objects with no other states that
affect which public methods may be called (semi-constructed objects of
this form are particularly hard to work with correctly).

\protect\hypertarget{Explicit_Constructors}{}{}

\hypertarget{implicit-conversions}{%
\subsection{Implicit Conversions}\label{implicit-conversions}}

Do not define implicit conversions. Use the \texttt{explicit} keyword
for conversion operators and single-argument constructors.

Implicit conversions allow an object of one type (called the {source
type}) to be used where a different type (called the {destination type})
is expected, such as when passing an \texttt{int} argument to a function
that takes a \texttt{double} parameter.

In addition to the implicit conversions defined by the language, users
can define their own, by adding appropriate members to the class
definition of the source or destination type. An implicit conversion in
the source type is defined by a type conversion operator named after the
destination type (e.g., \texttt{operator\ bool()}). An implicit
conversion in the destination type is defined by a constructor that can
take the source type as its only argument (or only argument with no
default value).

The \texttt{explicit} keyword can be applied to a constructor or (since
C++11) a conversion operator, to ensure that it can only be used when
the destination type is explicit at the point of use, e.g., with a cast.
This applies not only to implicit conversions, but to C++11's list
initialization syntax:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ Foo \{}
  \KeywordTok{explicit}\NormalTok{ Foo(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ x, }\DataTypeTok{double}\NormalTok{ y);}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\};}

\DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ Func(Foo f);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Func(\{}\DecValTok{42}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{3.14}\NormalTok{\});  }\CommentTok{// Error}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This kind of code isn't technically an implicit conversion, but the
language treats it as one as far as \texttt{explicit} is concerned.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Implicit conversions can make a type more usable and expressive by
  eliminating the need to explicitly name a type when it's obvious.
\item
  Implicit conversions can be a simpler alternative to overloading, such
  as when a single function with a \texttt{string\_view} parameter takes
  the place of separate overloads for \texttt{std::string} and
  \texttt{const\ char*}.
\item
  List initialization syntax is a concise and expressive way of
  initializing objects.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Implicit conversions can hide type-mismatch bugs, where the
  destination type does not match the user's expectation, or the user is
  unaware that any conversion will take place.
\item
  Implicit conversions can make code harder to read, particularly in the
  presence of overloading, by making it less obvious what code is
  actually getting called.
\item
  Constructors that take a single argument may accidentally be usable as
  implicit type conversions, even if they are not intended to do so.
\item
  When a single-argument constructor is not marked \texttt{explicit},
  there's no reliable way to tell whether it's intended to define an
  implicit conversion, or the author simply forgot to mark it.
\item
  Implicit conversions can lead to call-site ambiguities, especially
  when there are bidirectional implicit conversions. This can be caused
  either by having two types that both provide an implicit conversion,
  or by a single type that has both an implicit constructor and an
  implicit type conversion operator.
\item
  List initialization can suffer from the same problems if the
  destination type is implicit, particularly if the list has only a
  single element.
\end{itemize}

Type conversion operators, and constructors that are callable with a
single argument, must be marked \texttt{explicit} in the class
definition. As an exception, copy and move constructors should not be
\texttt{explicit}, since they do not perform type conversion.

Implicit conversions can sometimes be necessary and appropriate for
types that are designed to be interchangeable, for example when objects
of two types are just different representations of the same underlying
value. In that case, contact your project leads to request a waiver of
this rule.

Constructors that cannot be called with a single argument may omit
\texttt{explicit}. Constructors that take a single
\texttt{std::initializer\_list} parameter should also omit
\texttt{explicit}, in order to support copy-initialization (e.g.,
\texttt{MyType\ m\ =\ \{1,\ 2\};}).

\hypertarget{copyable-and-movable-types}{%
\subsection{Copyable and Movable
Types}\label{copyable-and-movable-types}}

\protect\hypertarget{Copy_Constructors}{}{}

A class's public API must make clear whether the class is copyable,
move-only, or neither copyable nor movable. Support copying and/or
moving if these operations are clear and meaningful for your type.

A movable type is one that can be initialized and assigned from
temporaries.

A copyable type is one that can be initialized or assigned from any
other object of the same type (so is also movable by definition), with
the stipulation that the value of the source does not change.
\texttt{std::unique\_ptr\textless{}int\textgreater{}} is an example of a
movable but not copyable type (since the value of the source
\texttt{std::unique\_ptr\textless{}int\textgreater{}} must be modified
during assignment to the destination). \texttt{int} and
\texttt{std::string} are examples of movable types that are also
copyable. (For \texttt{int}, the move and copy operations are the same;
for \texttt{std::string}, there exists a move operation that is less
expensive than a copy.)

For user-defined types, the copy behavior is defined by the copy
constructor and the copy-assignment operator. Move behavior is defined
by the move constructor and the move-assignment operator, if they exist,
or by the copy constructor and the copy-assignment operator otherwise.

The copy/move constructors can be implicitly invoked by the compiler in
some situations, e.g., when passing objects by value.

Objects of copyable and movable types can be passed and returned by
value, which makes APIs simpler, safer, and more general. Unlike when
passing objects by pointer or reference, there's no risk of confusion
over ownership, lifetime, mutability, and similar issues, and no need to
specify them in the contract. It also prevents non-local interactions
between the client and the implementation, which makes them easier to
understand, maintain, and optimize by the compiler. Further, such
objects can be used with generic APIs that require pass-by-value, such
as most containers, and they allow for additional flexibility in e.g.,
type composition.

Copy/move constructors and assignment operators are usually easier to
define correctly than alternatives like \texttt{Clone()},
\texttt{CopyFrom()} or \texttt{Swap()}, because they can be generated by
the compiler, either implicitly or with \texttt{=\ default}. They are
concise, and ensure that all data members are copied. Copy and move
constructors are also generally more efficient, because they don't
require heap allocation or separate initialization and assignment steps,
and they're eligible for optimizations such as
\href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision}{copy
elision}.

Move operations allow the implicit and efficient transfer of resources
out of rvalue objects. This allows a plainer coding style in some cases.

Some types do not need to be copyable, and providing copy operations for
such types can be confusing, nonsensical, or outright incorrect. Types
representing singleton objects (\texttt{Registerer}), objects tied to a
specific scope (\texttt{Cleanup}), or closely coupled to object identity
(\texttt{Mutex}) cannot be copied meaningfully. Copy operations for base
class types that are to be used polymorphically are hazardous, because
use of them can lead to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing}{object slicing}.
Defaulted or carelessly-implemented copy operations can be incorrect,
and the resulting bugs can be confusing and difficult to diagnose.

Copy constructors are invoked implicitly, which makes the invocation
easy to miss. This may cause confusion for programmers used to languages
where pass-by-reference is conventional or mandatory. It may also
encourage excessive copying, which can cause performance problems.

Every class's public interface must make clear which copy and move
operations the class supports. This should usually take the form of
explicitly declaring and/or deleting the appropriate operations in the
\texttt{public} section of the declaration.

Specifically, a copyable class should explicitly declare the copy
operations, a move-only class should explicitly declare the move
operations, and a non-copyable/movable class should explicitly delete
the copy operations. Explicitly declaring or deleting all four copy/move
operations is permitted, but not required. If you provide a copy or move
assignment operator, you must also provide the corresponding
constructor.

\NormalTok{      = }\KeywordTok{delete}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

These declarations/deletions can be omitted only if they are obvious:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the class has no \texttt{private} section, like a
  \protect\hyperlink{Structs_vs._Classes}{struct} or an interface-only
  base class, then the copyability/movability can be determined by the
  copyability/movability of any public data members.
\item
  If a base class clearly isn't copyable or movable, derived classes
  naturally won't be either. An interface-only base class that leaves
  these operations implicit is not sufficient to make concrete
  subclasses clear.
\item
  Note that if you explicitly declare or delete either the constructor
  or assignment operation for copy, the other copy operation is not
  obvious and must be declared or deleted. Likewise for move operations.
\end{itemize}

A type should not be copyable/movable if the meaning of copying/moving
is unclear to a casual user, or if it incurs unexpected costs. Move
operations for copyable types are strictly a performance optimization
and are a potential source of bugs and complexity, so avoid defining
them unless they are significantly more efficient than the corresponding
copy operations. If your type provides copy operations, it is
recommended that you design your class so that the default
implementation of those operations is correct. Remember to review the
correctness of any defaulted operations as you would any other code.

Due to the risk of slicing, prefer to avoid providing a public
assignment operator or copy/move constructor for a class that's intended
to be derived from (and prefer to avoid deriving from a class with such
members). If your base class needs to be copyable, provide a public
virtual \texttt{Clone()} method, and a protected copy constructor that
derived classes can use to implement it.

\hypertarget{structs-vs.-classes}{%
\subsection{Structs vs.~Classes}\label{structs-vs.-classes}}

Use a \texttt{struct} only for passive objects that carry data;
everything else is a \texttt{class}.

The \texttt{struct} and \texttt{class} keywords behave almost
identically in C++. We add our own semantic meanings to each keyword, so
you should use the appropriate keyword for the data-type you're
defining.

\texttt{structs} should be used for passive objects that carry data, and
may have associated constants. All fields must be public. The struct
must not have invariants that imply relationships between different
fields, since direct user access to those fields may break those
invariants. Constructors, destructors, and helper methods may be
present; however, these methods must not require or enforce any
invariants.

If more functionality or invariants are required, a \texttt{class} is
more appropriate. If in doubt, make it a \texttt{class}.

For consistency with STL, you can use \texttt{struct} instead of
\texttt{class} for stateless types, such as traits,
\protect\hyperlink{Template_metaprogramming}{template metafunctions},
and some functors.

Note that member variables in structs and classes have
\protect\hyperlink{Variable_Names}{different naming rules}.

\hypertarget{structs-vs.-pairs-and-tuples}{%
\subsection{Structs vs.~Pairs and
Tuples}\label{structs-vs.-pairs-and-tuples}}

Prefer to use a \texttt{struct} instead of a pair or a tuple whenever
the elements can have meaningful names.

While using pairs and tuples can avoid the need to define a custom type,
potentially saving work when \emph{writing} code, a meaningful field
name will almost always be much clearer when \emph{reading} code than
\texttt{.first}, \texttt{.second}, or
\texttt{std::get\textless{}X\textgreater{}}. While C++14's introduction
of \texttt{std::get\textless{}Type\textgreater{}} to access a tuple
element by type rather than index (when the type is unique) can
sometimes partially mitigate this, a field name is usually substantially
clearer and more informative than a type.

Pairs and tuples may be appropriate in generic code where there are not
specific meanings for the elements of the pair or tuple. Their use may
also be required in order to interoperate with existing code or APIs.

\protect\hypertarget{Multiple_Inheritance}{}{}

\hypertarget{inheritance}{%
\subsection{Inheritance}\label{inheritance}}

Composition is often more appropriate than inheritance. When using
inheritance, make it \texttt{public}.

When a sub-class inherits from a base class, it includes the definitions
of all the data and operations that the base class defines. ``Interface
inheritance'' is inheritance from a pure abstract base class (one with
no state or defined methods); all other inheritance is ``implementation
inheritance''.

Implementation inheritance reduces code size by re-using the base class
code as it specializes an existing type. Because inheritance is a
compile-time declaration, you and the compiler can understand the
operation and detect errors. Interface inheritance can be used to
programmatically enforce that a class expose a particular API. Again,
the compiler can detect errors, in this case, when a class does not
define a necessary method of the API.

For implementation inheritance, because the code implementing a
sub-class is spread between the base and the sub-class, it can be more
difficult to understand an implementation. The sub-class cannot override
functions that are not virtual, so the sub-class cannot change
implementation.

Multiple inheritance is especially problematic, because it often imposes
a higher performance overhead (in fact, the performance drop from single
inheritance to multiple inheritance can often be greater than the
performance drop from ordinary to virtual dispatch), and because it
risks leading to ``diamond'' inheritance patterns, which are prone to
ambiguity, confusion, and outright bugs.

All inheritance should be \texttt{public}. If you want to do private
inheritance, you should be including an instance of the base class as a
member instead.

Do not overuse implementation inheritance. Composition is often more
appropriate. Try to restrict use of inheritance to the ``is-a'' case:
\texttt{Bar} subclasses \texttt{Foo} if it can reasonably be said that
\texttt{Bar} ``is a kind of'' \texttt{Foo}.

Limit the use of \texttt{protected} to those member functions that might
need to be accessed from subclasses. Note that
\protect\hyperlink{Access_Control}{data members should be private}.

Explicitly annotate overrides of virtual functions or virtual
destructors with exactly one of an \texttt{override} or (less
frequently) \texttt{final} specifier. Do not use \texttt{virtual} when
declaring an override. Rationale: A function or destructor marked
\texttt{override} or \texttt{final} that is not an override of a base
class virtual function will not compile, and this helps catch common
errors. The specifiers serve as documentation; if no specifier is
present, the reader has to check all ancestors of the class in question
to determine if the function or destructor is virtual or not.

Multiple inheritance is permitted, but multiple \emph{implementation}
inheritance is strongly discouraged.

\hypertarget{operator-overloading}{%
\subsection{Operator Overloading}\label{operator-overloading}}

Overload operators judiciously. Do not use user-defined literals.

C++ permits user code to
\href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators}{declare
overloaded versions of the built-in operators} using the
\texttt{operator} keyword, so long as one of the parameters is a
user-defined type. The \texttt{operator} keyword also permits user code
to define new kinds of literals using \texttt{operator""}, and to define
type-conversion functions such as \texttt{operator\ bool()}.

Operator overloading can make code more concise and intuitive by
enabling user-defined types to behave the same as built-in types.
Overloaded operators are the idiomatic names for certain operations
(e.g., \texttt{==}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{=}, and
\texttt{\textless{}\textless{}}), and adhering to those conventions can
make user-defined types more readable and enable them to interoperate
with libraries that expect those names.

User-defined literals are a very concise notation for creating objects
of user-defined types.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Providing a correct, consistent, and unsurprising set of operator
  overloads requires some care, and failure to do so can lead to
  confusion and bugs.
\item
  Overuse of operators can lead to obfuscated code, particularly if the
  overloaded operator's semantics don't follow convention.
\item
  The hazards of function overloading apply just as much to operator
  overloading, if not more so.
\item
  Operator overloads can fool our intuition into thinking that expensive
  operations are cheap, built-in operations.
\item
  Finding the call sites for overloaded operators may require a search
  tool that's aware of C++ syntax, rather than e.g., grep.
\item
  If you get the argument type of an overloaded operator wrong, you may
  get a different overload rather than a compiler error. For example,
  \texttt{foo\ \textless{}\ bar} may do one thing, while
  \texttt{\&foo\ \textless{}\ \&bar} does something totally different.
\item
  Certain operator overloads are inherently hazardous. Overloading unary
  \texttt{\&} can cause the same code to have different meanings
  depending on whether the overload declaration is visible. Overloads of
  \texttt{\&\&}, \texttt{\textbar{}\textbar{}}, and \texttt{,} (comma)
  cannot match the evaluation-order semantics of the built-in operators.
\item
  Operators are often defined outside the class, so there's a risk of
  different files introducing different definitions of the same
  operator. If both definitions are linked into the same binary, this
  results in undefined behavior, which can manifest as subtle run-time
  bugs.
\item
  User-defined literals (UDLs) allow the creation of new syntactic forms
  that are unfamiliar even to experienced C++ programmers, such as
  \texttt{"Hello\ World"sv} as a shorthand for
  \texttt{std::string\_view("Hello\ \ \ \ \ World")}. Existing notations
  are clearer, though less terse.
\item
  Because they can't be namespace-qualified, uses of UDLs also require
  use of either using-directives (which
  \protect\hyperlink{Namespaces}{we ban}) or using-declarations (which
  \protect\hyperlink{Aliases}{we ban in header files} except when the
  imported names are part of the interface exposed by the header file in
  question). Given that header files would have to avoid UDL suffixes,
  we prefer to avoid having conventions for literals differ between
  header files and source files.
\end{itemize}

Define overloaded operators only if their meaning is obvious,
unsurprising, and consistent with the corresponding built-in operators.
For example, use \texttt{\textbar{}} as a bitwise- or logical-or, not as
a shell-style pipe.

Define operators only on your own types. More precisely, define them in
the same headers, .cc files, and namespaces as the types they operate
on. That way, the operators are available wherever the type is,
minimizing the risk of multiple definitions. If possible, avoid defining
operators as templates, because they must satisfy this rule for any
possible template arguments. If you define an operator, also define any
related operators that make sense, and make sure they are defined
consistently. For example, if you overload \texttt{\textless{}},
overload all the comparison operators, and make sure
\texttt{\textless{}} and \texttt{\textgreater{}} never return true for
the same arguments.

Prefer to define non-modifying binary operators as non-member functions.
If a binary operator is defined as a class member, implicit conversions
will apply to the right-hand argument, but not the left-hand one. It
will confuse your users if \texttt{a\ \textless{}\ b} compiles but
\texttt{b\ \textless{}\ a} doesn't.

Don't go out of your way to avoid defining operator overloads. For
example, prefer to define \texttt{==}, \texttt{=}, and
\texttt{\textless{}\textless{}}, rather than \texttt{Equals()},
\texttt{CopyFrom()}, and \texttt{PrintTo()}. Conversely, don't define
operator overloads just because other libraries expect them. For
example, if your type doesn't have a natural ordering, but you want to
store it in a \texttt{std::set}, use a custom comparator rather than
overloading \texttt{\textless{}}.

Do not overload \texttt{\&\&}, \texttt{\textbar{}\textbar{}}, \texttt{,}
(comma), or unary \texttt{\&}. Do not overload \texttt{operator""},
i.e., do not introduce user-defined literals. Do not use any such
literals provided by others (including the standard library).

Type conversion operators are covered in the section on
\protect\hyperlink{Implicit_Conversions}{implicit conversions}. The
\texttt{=} operator is covered in the section on
\protect\hyperlink{Copy_Constructors}{copy constructors}. Overloading
\texttt{\textless{}\textless{}} for use with streams is covered in the
section on \protect\hyperlink{Streams}{streams}. See also the rules on
\protect\hyperlink{Function_Overloading}{function overloading}, which
apply to operator overloading as well.

\hypertarget{access-control}{%
\subsection{Access Control}\label{access-control}}

Make classes' data members \texttt{private}, unless they are
\protect\hyperlink{Constant_Names}{constants}. This simplifies reasoning
about invariants, at the cost of some easy boilerplate in the form of
accessors (usually \texttt{const}) if necessary.

For technical reasons, we allow data members of a test fixture class
defined in a .cc file to be \texttt{protected} when using
\href{https://github.com/google/googletest}{Google Test}). If a test
fixture class is defined outside of the .cc file it is used in, for
example in a .h file, make data members \texttt{private}.

\hypertarget{declaration-order}{%
\subsection{Declaration Order}\label{declaration-order}}

Group similar declarations together, placing public parts earlier.

A class definition should usually start with a \texttt{public:} section,
followed by \texttt{protected:}, then \texttt{private:}. Omit sections
that would be empty.

Within each section, generally prefer grouping similar kinds of
declarations together, and generally prefer the following order: types
(including \texttt{typedef}, \texttt{using}, and nested structs and
classes), constants, factory functions, constructors and assignment
operators, destructor, all other methods, data members.

Do not put large method definitions inline in the class definition.
Usually, only trivial or performance-critical, and very short, methods
may be defined inline. See \protect\hyperlink{Inline_Functions}{Inline
Functions} for more details.

\hypertarget{functions}{%
\section{Functions}\label{functions}}

\protect\hypertarget{Function_Parameter_Ordering}{}{}
\protect\hypertarget{Output_Parameters}{}{}

\hypertarget{inputs-and-outputs}{%
\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}\label{inputs-and-outputs}}

The output of a C++ function is naturally provided via a return value
and sometimes via output parameters (or in/out parameters).

Prefer using return values over output parameters: they improve
readability, and often provide the same or better performance.

Parameters are either input to the function, output from the function,
or both. Input parameters should usually be values or \texttt{const}
references, while required (non-nullable) output and input/output
parameters should usually be references. Generally, use
\texttt{absl::optional} to represent optional inputs, and
non-\texttt{const} pointers to represent optional outputs.

Avoid defining functions that require a \texttt{const} reference
parameter to outlive the call, because \texttt{const} reference
parameters bind to temporaries. Instead, find a way to eliminate the
lifetime requirement (for example, by copying the parameter), or pass it
by \texttt{const} pointer and document the non-null requirement.

When ordering function parameters, put all input-only parameters before
any output parameters. In particular, do not add new parameters to the
end of the function just because they are new; place new input-only
parameters before the output parameters. This is not a hard-and-fast
rule. Parameters that are both input and output muddy the waters, and,
as always, consistency with related functions may require you to bend
the rule. Variadic functions may also require unusual parameter
ordering.

\hypertarget{write-short-functions}{%
\subsection{Write Short Functions}\label{write-short-functions}}

Prefer small and focused functions.

We recognize that long functions are sometimes appropriate, so no hard
limit is placed on functions length. If a function exceeds about 40
lines, think about whether it can be broken up without harming the
structure of the program.

Even if your long function works perfectly now, someone modifying it in
a few months may add new behavior. This could result in bugs that are
hard to find. Keeping your functions short and simple makes it easier
for other people to read and modify your code. Small functions are also
easier to test.

You could find long and complicated functions when working with some
code. Do not be intimidated by modifying existing code: if working with
such a function proves to be difficult, you find that errors are hard to
debug, or you want to use a piece of it in several different contexts,
consider breaking up the function into smaller and more manageable
pieces.

\hypertarget{function-overloading}{%
\subsection{Function Overloading}\label{function-overloading}}

Use overloaded functions (including constructors) only if a reader
looking at a call site can get a good idea of what is happening without
having to first figure out exactly which overload is being called.

You may write a function that takes a \texttt{const\ std::string\&} and
overload it with another that takes \texttt{const\ char*}. However, in
this case consider std::string\_view instead.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ MyClass \{}
 \KeywordTok{public}\NormalTok{:}
  \DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ Analyze(}\AttributeTok{const} \BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string \&text);}
  \DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ Analyze(}\AttributeTok{const} \DataTypeTok{char}\NormalTok{ *text, }\DataTypeTok{size\_t}\NormalTok{ textlen);}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Overloading can make code more intuitive by allowing an
identically-named function to take different arguments. It may be
necessary for templatized code, and it can be convenient for Visitors.

Overloading based on const or ref qualification may make utility code
more usable, more efficient, or both. (See
\href{http://abseil.io/tips/148}{TotW 148} for more.)

If a function is overloaded by the argument types alone, a reader may
have to understand C++'s complex matching rules in order to tell what's
going on. Also many people are confused by the semantics of inheritance
if a derived class overrides only some of the variants of a function.

You may overload a function when there are no semantic differences
between variants. These overloads may vary in types, qualifiers, or
argument count. However, a reader of such a call must not need to know
which member of the overload set is chosen, only that \textbf{something}
from the set is being called. If you can document all entries in the
overload set with a single comment in the header, that is a good sign
that it is a well-designed overload set.

\hypertarget{default-arguments}{%
\subsection{Default Arguments}\label{default-arguments}}

Default arguments are allowed on non-virtual functions when the default
is guaranteed to always have the same value. Follow the same
restrictions as for \protect\hyperlink{Function_Overloading}{function
overloading}, and prefer overloaded functions if the readability gained
with default arguments doesn't outweigh the downsides below.

Often you have a function that uses default values, but occasionally you
want to override the defaults. Default parameters allow an easy way to
do this without having to define many functions for the rare exceptions.
Compared to overloading the function, default arguments have a cleaner
syntax, with less boilerplate and a clearer distinction between
`required' and `optional' arguments.

Defaulted arguments are another way to achieve the semantics of
overloaded functions, so all the
\protect\hyperlink{Function_Overloading}{reasons not to overload
functions} apply.

The defaults for arguments in a virtual function call are determined by
the static type of the target object, and there's no guarantee that all
overrides of a given function declare the same defaults.

Default parameters are re-evaluated at each call site, which can bloat
the generated code. Readers may also expect the default's value to be
fixed at the declaration instead of varying at each call.

Function pointers are confusing in the presence of default arguments,
since the function signature often doesn't match the call signature.
Adding function overloads avoids these problems.

Default arguments are banned on virtual functions, where they don't work
properly, and in cases where the specified default might not evaluate to
the same value depending on when it was evaluated. (For example, don't
write \texttt{void\ f(int\ n\ =\ counter++);}.)

In some other cases, default arguments can improve the readability of
their function declarations enough to overcome the downsides above, so
they are allowed. When in doubt, use overloads.

\hypertarget{trailing-return-type-syntax}{%
\subsection{Trailing Return Type
Syntax}\label{trailing-return-type-syntax}}

Use trailing return types only where using the ordinary syntax (leading
return types) is impractical or much less readable.

C++ allows two different forms of function declarations. In the older
form, the return type appears before the function name. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ foo(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ x);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The newer form, introduced in C++11, uses the \texttt{auto} keyword
before the function name and a trailing return type after the argument
list. For example, the declaration above could equivalently be written:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ foo(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ x) {-}\textgreater{} }\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The trailing return type is in the function's scope. This doesn't make a
difference for a simple case like \texttt{int} but it matters for more
complicated cases, like types declared in class scope or types written
in terms of the function parameters.

Trailing return types are the only way to explicitly specify the return
type of a \protect\hyperlink{Lambda_expressions}{lambda expression}. In
some cases the compiler is able to deduce a lambda's return type, but
not in all cases. Even when the compiler can deduce it automatically,
sometimes specifying it explicitly would be clearer for readers.

Sometimes it's easier and more readable to specify a return type after
the function's parameter list has already appeared. This is particularly
true when the return type depends on template parameters. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
    template <typename T, typename U>
    auto add(T t, U u) -> decltype(t + u);
\end{verbatim}

versus

\begin{verbatim}
    template <typename T, typename U>
    decltype(declval<T&>() + declval<U&>()) add(T t, U u);
\end{verbatim}

Trailing return type syntax is relatively new and it has no analogue in
C++-like languages such as C and Java, so some readers may find it
unfamiliar.

Existing code bases have an enormous number of function declarations
that aren't going to get changed to use the new syntax, so the realistic
choices are using the old syntax only or using a mixture of the two.
Using a single version is better for uniformity of style.

In most cases, continue to use the older style of function declaration
where the return type goes before the function name. Use the new
trailing-return-type form only in cases where it's required (such as
lambdas) or where, by putting the type after the function's parameter
list, it allows you to write the type in a much more readable way. The
latter case should be rare; it's mostly an issue in fairly complicated
template code, which is
\protect\hyperlink{Template_metaprogramming}{discouraged in most cases}.

\hypertarget{ownership-and-smart-pointers}{%
\subsection{Ownership and Smart
Pointers}\label{ownership-and-smart-pointers}}

Prefer to have single, fixed owners for dynamically allocated objects.
Prefer to transfer ownership with smart pointers.

``Ownership'' is a bookkeeping technique for managing dynamically
allocated memory (and other resources). The owner of a dynamically
allocated object is an object or function that is responsible for
ensuring that it is deleted when no longer needed. Ownership can
sometimes be shared, in which case the last owner is typically
responsible for deleting it. Even when ownership is not shared, it can
be transferred from one piece of code to another.

``Smart'' pointers are classes that act like pointers, e.g., by
overloading the \texttt{*} and \texttt{-\textgreater{}} operators. Some
smart pointer types can be used to automate ownership bookkeeping, to
ensure these responsibilities are met.
\href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr}{\texttt{std::unique\_ptr}}
is a smart pointer type introduced in C++11, which expresses exclusive
ownership of a dynamically allocated object; the object is deleted when
the \texttt{std::unique\_ptr} goes out of scope. It cannot be copied,
but can be \emph{moved} to represent ownership transfer.
\href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr}{\texttt{std::shared\_ptr}}
is a smart pointer type that expresses shared ownership of a dynamically
allocated object. \texttt{std::shared\_ptr}s can be copied; ownership of
the object is shared among all copies, and the object is deleted when
the last \texttt{std::shared\_ptr} is destroyed.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It's virtually impossible to manage dynamically allocated memory
  without some sort of ownership logic.
\item
  Transferring ownership of an object can be cheaper than copying it (if
  copying it is even possible).
\item
  Transferring ownership can be simpler than `borrowing' a pointer or
  reference, because it reduces the need to coordinate the lifetime of
  the object between the two users.
\item
  Smart pointers can improve readability by making ownership logic
  explicit, self-documenting, and unambiguous.
\item
  Smart pointers can eliminate manual ownership bookkeeping, simplifying
  the code and ruling out large classes of errors.
\item
  For const objects, shared ownership can be a simple and efficient
  alternative to deep copying.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ownership must be represented and transferred via pointers (whether
  smart or plain). Pointer semantics are more complicated than value
  semantics, especially in APIs: you have to worry not just about
  ownership, but also aliasing, lifetime, and mutability, among other
  issues.
\item
  The performance costs of value semantics are often overestimated, so
  the performance benefits of ownership transfer might not justify the
  readability and complexity costs.
\item
  APIs that transfer ownership force their clients into a single memory
  management model.
\item
  Code using smart pointers is less explicit about where the resource
  releases take place.
\item
  \texttt{std::unique\_ptr} expresses ownership transfer using C++11's
  move semantics, which are relatively new and may confuse some
  programmers.
\item
  Shared ownership can be a tempting alternative to careful ownership
  design, obfuscating the design of a system.
\item
  Shared ownership requires explicit bookkeeping at run-time, which can
  be costly.
\item
  In some cases (e.g., cyclic references), objects with shared ownership
  may never be deleted.
\item
  Smart pointers are not perfect substitutes for plain pointers.
\end{itemize}

If dynamic allocation is necessary, prefer to keep ownership with the
code that allocated it. If other code needs access to the object,
consider passing it a copy, or passing a pointer or reference without
transferring ownership. Prefer to use \texttt{std::unique\_ptr} to make
ownership transfer explicit. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{unique\_ptr\textless{}Foo\textgreater{} FooFactory();}
\DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ FooConsumer(}\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{unique\_ptr\textless{}Foo\textgreater{} ptr);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Do not design your code to use shared ownership without a very good
reason. One such reason is to avoid expensive copy operations, but you
should only do this if the performance benefits are significant, and the
underlying object is immutable (i.e.,
\texttt{std::shared\_ptr\textless{}const\ Foo\textgreater{}}). If you do
use shared ownership, prefer to use \texttt{std::shared\_ptr}.

Never use \texttt{std::auto\_ptr}. Instead, use
\texttt{std::unique\_ptr}.

\section{Other C++ Features}\label{other-c-features}}

\hypertarget{rvalue-references}{%
\subsection{Rvalue References}\label{rvalue-references}}

Use rvalue references only in certain special cases listed below.

Rvalue references are a type of reference that can only bind to
temporary objects. The syntax is similar to traditional reference
syntax. For example, \texttt{void\ f(std::string\&\&\ s);} declares a
function whose argument is an rvalue reference to a std::string.

When the token `\&\&' is applied to an unqualified template argument in
a function parameter, special template argument deduction rules apply.
Such a reference is called forwarding reference.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Defining a move constructor (a constructor taking an rvalue reference
  to the class type) makes it possible to move a value instead of
  copying it. If \texttt{v1} is a
  \texttt{std::vector\textless{}std::string\textgreater{}}, for example,
  then \texttt{auto\ v2(std::move(v1))} will probably just result in
  some simple pointer manipulation instead of copying a large amount of
  data. In many cases this can result in a major performance
  improvement.
\item
  Rvalue references make it possible to implement types that are movable
  but not copyable, which can be useful for types that have no sensible
  definition of copying but where you might still want to pass them as
  function arguments, put them in containers, etc.
\item
  \texttt{std::move} is necessary to make effective use of some
  standard-library types, such as \texttt{std::unique\_ptr}.
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{Forwarding_references}{Forwarding references} which
  use the rvalue reference token, make it possible to write a generic
  function wrapper that forwards its arguments to another function, and
  works whether or not its arguments are temporary objects and/or const.
  This is called `perfect forwarding'.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rvalue references are not yet widely understood. Rules like reference
  collapsing and the special deduction rule for forwarding references
  are somewhat obscure.
\item
  Rvalue references are often misused. Using rvalue references is
  counter-intuitive in signatures where the argument is expected to have
  a valid specified state after the function call, or where no move
  operation is performed.
\end{itemize}

Do not use rvalue references (or apply the \texttt{\&\&} qualifier to
methods), except as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You may use them to define move constructors and move assignment
  operators (as described in
  \protect\hyperlink{Copyable_Movable_Types}{Copyable and Movable
  Types}).
\item
  You may use them to define \texttt{\&\&}-qualified methods that
  logically ``consume'' \texttt{*this}, leaving it in an unusable or
  empty state. Note that this applies only to method qualifiers (which
  come after the closing parenthesis of the function signature); if you
  want to ``consume'' an ordinary function parameter, prefer to pass it
  by value.
\item
  You may use forwarding references in conjunction with
  \texttt{std::forward}, to support perfect forwarding.
\item
  You may use them to define pairs of overloads, such as one taking
  \texttt{Foo\&\&} and the other taking \texttt{const\ Foo\&}. Usually
  the preferred solution is just to pass by value, but an overloaded
  pair of functions sometimes yields better performance and is sometimes
  necessary in generic code that needs to support a wide variety of
  types. As always: if you're writing more complicated code for the sake
  of performance, make sure you have evidence that it actually helps.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{friends}{%
\subsection{Friends}\label{friends}}

We allow use of \texttt{friend} classes and functions, within reason.

Friends should usually be defined in the same file so that the reader
does not have to look in another file to find uses of the private
members of a class. A common use of \texttt{friend} is to have a
\texttt{FooBuilder} class be a friend of \texttt{Foo} so that it can
construct the inner state of \texttt{Foo} correctly, without exposing
this state to the world. In some cases it may be useful to make a
unittest class a friend of the class it tests.

Friends extend, but do not break, the encapsulation boundary of a class.
In some cases this is better than making a member public when you want
to give only one other class access to it. However, most classes should
interact with other classes solely through their public members.

\hypertarget{exceptions}{%
\subsection{Exceptions}\label{exceptions}}

We do not use C++ exceptions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Exceptions allow higher levels of an application to decide how to
  handle ``can't happen'' failures in deeply nested functions, without
  the obscuring and error-prone bookkeeping of error codes.
\item
  Exceptions are used by most other modern languages. Using them in C++
  would make it more consistent with Python, Java, and the C++ that
  others are familiar with.
\item
  Some third-party C++ libraries use exceptions, and turning them off
  internally makes it harder to integrate with those libraries.
\item
  Exceptions are the only way for a constructor to fail. We can simulate
  this with a factory function or an \texttt{Init()} method, but these
  require heap allocation or a new ``invalid'' state, respectively.
\item
  Exceptions are really handy in testing frameworks.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When you add a \texttt{throw} statement to an existing function, you
  must examine all of its transitive callers. Either they must make at
  least the basic exception safety guarantee, or they must never catch
  the exception and be happy with the program terminating as a result.
  For instance, if \texttt{f()} calls \texttt{g()} calls \texttt{h()},
  and \texttt{h} throws an exception that \texttt{f} catches, \texttt{g}
  has to be careful or it may not clean up properly.
\item
  More generally, exceptions make the control flow of programs difficult
  to evaluate by looking at code: functions may return in places you
  don't expect. This causes maintainability and debugging difficulties.
  You can minimize this cost via some rules on how and where exceptions
  can be used, but at the cost of more that a developer needs to know
  and understand.
\item
  Exception safety requires both RAII and different coding practices.
  Lots of supporting machinery is needed to make writing correct
  exception-safe code easy. Further, to avoid requiring readers to
  understand the entire call graph, exception-safe code must isolate
  logic that writes to persistent state into a ``commit'' phase. This
  will have both benefits and costs (perhaps where you're forced to
  obfuscate code to isolate the commit). Allowing exceptions would force
  us to always pay those costs even when they're not worth it.
\item
  Turning on exceptions adds data to each binary produced, increasing
  compile time (probably slightly) and possibly increasing address space
  pressure.
\item
  The availability of exceptions may encourage developers to throw them
  when they are not appropriate or recover from them when it's not safe
  to do so. For example, invalid user input should not cause exceptions
  to be thrown. We would need to make the style guide even longer to
  document these restrictions!
\end{itemize}

On their face, the benefits of using exceptions outweigh the costs,
especially in new projects. However, for existing code, the introduction
of exceptions has implications on all dependent code. If exceptions can
be propagated beyond a new project, it also becomes problematic to
integrate the new project into existing exception-free code. Because
most existing C++ code at Google is not prepared to deal with
exceptions, it is comparatively difficult to adopt new code that
generates exceptions.

Given that Google's existing code is not exception-tolerant, the costs
of using exceptions are somewhat greater than the costs in a new
project. The conversion process would be slow and error-prone. We don't
believe that the available alternatives to exceptions, such as error
codes and assertions, introduce a significant burden.

Our advice against using exceptions is not predicated on philosophical
or moral grounds, but practical ones. Because we'd like to use our
open-source projects at Google and it's difficult to do so if those
projects use exceptions, we need to advise against exceptions in Google
open-source projects as well. Things would probably be different if we
had to do it all over again from scratch.

This prohibition also applies to the exception handling related features
added in C++11, such as \texttt{std::exception\_ptr} and
\texttt{std::nested\_exception}.

There is an \protect\hyperlink{Windows_Code}{exception} to this rule (no
pun intended) for Windows code.

\hypertarget{noexcept}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{noexcept}}{noexcept}}\label{noexcept}}

Specify \texttt{noexcept} when it is useful and correct.

The \texttt{noexcept} specifier is used to specify whether a function
will throw exceptions or not. If an exception escapes from a function
marked \texttt{noexcept}, the program crashes via
\texttt{std::terminate}.

The \texttt{noexcept} operator performs a compile-time check that
returns true if an expression is declared to not throw any exceptions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Specifying move constructors as \texttt{noexcept} improves performance
  in some cases, e.g.,
  \texttt{std::vector\textless{}T\textgreater{}::resize()} moves rather
  than copies the objects if T's move constructor is \texttt{noexcept}.
\item
  Specifying \texttt{noexcept} on a function can trigger compiler
  optimizations in environments where exceptions are enabled, e.g.,
  compiler does not have to generate extra code for stack-unwinding, if
  it knows that no exceptions can be thrown due to a \texttt{noexcept}
  specifier.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In projects following this guide that have exceptions disabled it is
  hard to ensure that \texttt{noexcept} specifiers are correct, and hard
  to define what correctness even means.
\item
  It's hard, if not impossible, to undo \texttt{noexcept} because it
  eliminates a guarantee that callers may be relying on, in ways that
  are hard to detect.
\end{itemize}

You may use \texttt{noexcept} when it is useful for performance if it
accurately reflects the intended semantics of your function, i.e., that
if an exception is somehow thrown from within the function body then it
represents a fatal error. You can assume that \texttt{noexcept} on move
constructors has a meaningful performance benefit. If you think there is
significant performance benefit from specifying \texttt{noexcept} on
some other function, please discuss it with your project leads.

Prefer unconditional \texttt{noexcept} if exceptions are completely
disabled (i.e., most Google C++ environments). Otherwise, use
conditional \texttt{noexcept} specifiers with simple conditions, in ways
that evaluate false only in the few cases where the function could
potentially throw. The tests might include type traits check on whether
the involved operation might throw (e.g.,
\texttt{std::is\_nothrow\_move\_constructible} for move-constructing
objects), or on whether allocation can throw (e.g.,
\texttt{absl::default\_allocator\_is\_nothrow} for standard default
allocation). Note in many cases the only possible cause for an exception
is allocation failure (we believe move constructors should not throw
except due to allocation failure), and there are many applications where
it's appropriate to treat memory exhaustion as a fatal error rather than
an exceptional condition that your program should attempt to recover
from. Even for other potential failures you should prioritize interface
simplicity over supporting all possible exception throwing scenarios:
instead of writing a complicated \texttt{noexcept} clause that depends
on whether a hash function can throw, for example, simply document that
your component doesn't support hash functions throwing and make it
unconditionally \texttt{noexcept}.

\hypertarget{run-time-type-information-rtti}{%
\subsection{Run-Time Type Information
(RTTI)}\label{run-time-type-information-rtti}}

Avoid using Run Time Type Information (RTTI).

RTTI allows a programmer to query the C++ class of an object at run
time. This is done by use of \texttt{typeid} or \texttt{dynamic\_cast}.

The standard alternatives to RTTI (described below) require modification
or redesign of the class hierarchy in question. Sometimes such
modifications are infeasible or undesirable, particularly in widely-used
or mature code.

RTTI can be useful in some unit tests. For example, it is useful in
tests of factory classes where the test has to verify that a newly
created object has the expected dynamic type. It is also useful in
managing the relationship between objects and their mocks.

RTTI is useful when considering multiple abstract objects. Consider

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{bool}\NormalTok{ Base::Equal(Base* other) = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{;}
\DataTypeTok{bool}\NormalTok{ Derived::Equal(Base* other) \{}
\NormalTok{  Derived* that = }\KeywordTok{dynamic\_cast}\NormalTok{\textless{}Derived*\textgreater{}(other);}
  \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (that == }\KeywordTok{nullptr}\NormalTok{)}
    \ControlFlowTok{return} \KeywordTok{false}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Querying the type of an object at run-time frequently means a design
problem. Needing to know the type of an object at runtime is often an
indication that the design of your class hierarchy is flawed.

Undisciplined use of RTTI makes code hard to maintain. It can lead to
type-based decision trees or switch statements scattered throughout the
code, all of which must be examined when making further changes.

RTTI has legitimate uses but is prone to abuse, so you must be careful
when using it. You may use it freely in unittests, but avoid it when
possible in other code. In particular, think twice before using RTTI in
new code. If you find yourself needing to write code that behaves
differently based on the class of an object, consider one of the
following alternatives to querying the type:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Virtual methods are the preferred way of executing different code
  paths depending on a specific subclass type. This puts the work within
  the object itself.
\item
  If the work belongs outside the object and instead in some processing
  code, consider a double-dispatch solution, such as the Visitor design
  pattern. This allows a facility outside the object itself to determine
  the type of class using the built-in type system.
\end{itemize}

When the logic of a program guarantees that a given instance of a base
class is in fact an instance of a particular derived class, then a
\texttt{dynamic\_cast} may be used freely on the object. Usually one can
use a \texttt{static\_cast} as an alternative in such situations.

Decision trees based on type are a strong indication that your code is
on the wrong track.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (}\KeywordTok{typeid}\NormalTok{(*data) == }\KeywordTok{typeid}\NormalTok{(D1)) \{}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\} }\ControlFlowTok{else} \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (}\KeywordTok{typeid}\NormalTok{(*data) == }\KeywordTok{typeid}\NormalTok{(D2)) \{}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\} }\ControlFlowTok{else} \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (}\KeywordTok{typeid}\NormalTok{(*data) == }\KeywordTok{typeid}\NormalTok{(D3)) \{}
\NormalTok{...}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Code such as this usually breaks when additional subclasses are added to
the class hierarchy. Moreover, when properties of a subclass change, it
is difficult to find and modify all the affected code segments.

Do not hand-implement an RTTI-like workaround. The arguments against
RTTI apply just as much to workarounds like class hierarchies with type
tags. Moreover, workarounds disguise your true intent.

\hypertarget{casting}{%
\subsection{Casting}\label{casting}}

Use C++-style casts like
\texttt{static\_cast\textless{}float\textgreater{}(double\_value)}, or
brace initialization for conversion of arithmetic types like
\texttt{int64\ y\ =\ int64\{1\}\ \textless{}\textless{}\ 42}. Do not use
cast formats like \texttt{(int)x} unless the cast is to \texttt{void}.
You may use cast formats like `T(x)` only when `T` is a class type.

C++ introduced a different cast system from C that distinguishes the
types of cast operations.

The problem with C casts is the ambiguity of the operation; sometimes
you are doing a \emph{conversion} (e.g., \texttt{(int)3.5}) and
sometimes you are doing a \emph{cast} (e.g., \texttt{(int)"hello"}).
Brace initialization and C++ casts can often help avoid this ambiguity.
Additionally, C++ casts are more visible when searching for them.

The C++-style cast syntax is verbose and cumbersome.

In general, do not use C-style casts. Instead, use these C++-style casts
when explicit type conversion is necessary.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use brace initialization to convert arithmetic types (e.g.,
  \texttt{int64\{x\}}). This is the safest approach because code will
  not compile if conversion can result in information loss. The syntax
  is also concise.
\item
  Use \texttt{static\_cast} as the equivalent of a C-style cast that
  does value conversion, when you need to explicitly up-cast a pointer
  from a class to its superclass, or when you need to explicitly cast a
  pointer from a superclass to a subclass. In this last case, you must
  be sure your object is actually an instance of the subclass.
\item
  Use \texttt{const\_cast} to remove the \texttt{const} qualifier (see
  \protect\hyperlink{Use_of_const}{const}).
\item
  Use \texttt{reinterpret\_cast} to do unsafe conversions of pointer
  types to and from integer and other pointer types. Use this only if
  you know what you are doing and you understand the aliasing issues.
  Also, consider the alternative \texttt{absl::bit\_cast}.
\item
  Use \texttt{absl::bit\_cast} to interpret the raw bits of a value
  using a different type of the same size (a type pun), such as
  interpreting the bits of a \texttt{double} as \texttt{int64}.
\end{itemize}

See the \protect\hyperlink{Run-Time_Type_Information__RTTI_}{RTTI
section} for guidance on the use of \texttt{dynamic\_cast}.

\hypertarget{streams}{%
\subsection{Streams}\label{streams}}

Use streams where appropriate, and stick to ``simple'' usages. Overload
\texttt{\textless{}\textless{}} for streaming only for types
representing values, and write only the user-visible value, not any
implementation details.

Streams are the standard I/O abstraction in C++, as exemplified by the
standard header \texttt{\textless{}iostream\textgreater{}}. They are
widely used in Google code, mostly for debug logging and test
diagnostics.

The \texttt{\textless{}\textless{}} and
\texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}} stream operators provide an API
for formatted I/O that is easily learned, portable, reusable, and
extensible. \texttt{printf}, by contrast, doesn't even support
\texttt{std::string}, to say nothing of user-defined types, and is very
difficult to use portably. \texttt{printf} also obliges you to choose
among the numerous slightly different versions of that function, and
navigate the dozens of conversion specifiers.

Streams provide first-class support for console I/O via
\texttt{std::cin}, \texttt{std::cout}, \texttt{std::cerr}, and
\texttt{std::clog}. The C APIs do as well, but are hampered by the need
to manually buffer the input.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Stream formatting can be configured by mutating the state of the
  stream. Such mutations are persistent, so the behavior of your code
  can be affected by the entire previous history of the stream, unless
  you go out of your way to restore it to a known state every time other
  code might have touched it. User code can not only modify the built-in
  state, it can add new state variables and behaviors through a
  registration system.
\item
  It is difficult to precisely control stream output, due to the above
  issues, the way code and data are mixed in streaming code, and the use
  of operator overloading (which may select a different overload than
  you expect).
\item
  The practice of building up output through chains of
  \texttt{\textless{}\textless{}} operators interferes with
  internationalization, because it bakes word order into the code, and
  streams' support for localization is
  \href{http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/locale/doc/html/rationale.html\#rationale_why}{flawed}.
\item
  The streams API is subtle and complex, so programmers must develop
  experience with it in order to use it effectively.
\item
  Resolving the many overloads of \texttt{\textless{}\textless{}} is
  extremely costly for the compiler. When used pervasively in a large
  code base, it can consume as much as 20\% of the parsing and semantic
  analysis time.
\end{itemize}

Use streams only when they are the best tool for the job. This is
typically the case when the I/O is ad-hoc, local, human-readable, and
targeted at other developers rather than end-users. Be consistent with
the code around you, and with the codebase as a whole; if there's an
established tool for your problem, use that tool instead. In particular,
logging libraries are usually a better choice than \texttt{std::cerr} or
\texttt{std::clog} for diagnostic output, and the libraries in
\texttt{absl/strings} or the equivalent are usually a better choice than
\texttt{std::stringstream}.

Avoid using streams for I/O that faces external users or handles
untrusted data. Instead, find and use the appropriate templating
libraries to handle issues like internationalization, localization, and
security hardening.

If you do use streams, avoid the stateful parts of the streams API
(other than error state), such as \texttt{imbue()}, \texttt{xalloc()},
and \texttt{register\_callback()}. Use explicit formatting functions
(see e.g., \texttt{absl/strings}) rather than stream manipulators or
formatting flags to control formatting details such as number base,
precision, or padding.

Overload \texttt{\textless{}\textless{}} as a streaming operator for
your type only if your type represents a value, and
\texttt{\textless{}\textless{}} writes out a human-readable string
representation of that value. Avoid exposing implementation details in
the output of \texttt{\textless{}\textless{}}; if you need to print
object internals for debugging, use named functions instead (a method
named \texttt{DebugString()} is the most common convention).

\hypertarget{preincrement-and-predecrement}{%
\subsection{Preincrement and
Predecrement}\label{preincrement-and-predecrement}}

Use the prefix form (\texttt{++i}) of the increment and decrement
operators unless you need postfix semantics.

When a variable is incremented (\texttt{++i} or \texttt{i++}) or
decremented (\texttt{-\/-i} or \texttt{i-\/-}) and the value of the
expression is not used, one must decide whether to preincrement
(decrement) or postincrement (decrement).

A postfix increment/decrement expression evaluates to the value \emph{as
it was before it was modified}. This can result in code that is more
compact but harder to read. The prefix form is generally more readable,
is never less efficient, and can be more efficient because it doesn't
need to make a copy of the value as it was before the operation.

The tradition developed, in C, of using post-increment, even when the
expression value is not used, especially in \texttt{for} loops. Some
find post-increment easier to read, since the ``subject'' (\texttt{i})
precedes the ``verb'' (\texttt{++}), just like in English.

Use prefix increment/decrement, unless the code explicitly needs the
result of the postfix increment/decrement expression.

\hypertarget{use-of-const}{%
\subsection{Use of const}\label{use-of-const}}

In APIs, use \texttt{const} whenever it makes sense. \texttt{constexpr}
is a better choice for some uses of const.

Declared variables and parameters can be preceded by the keyword
\texttt{const} to indicate the variables are not changed (e.g.,
\texttt{const\ int\ foo}). Class functions can have the \texttt{const}
qualifier to indicate the function does not change the state of the
class member variables (e.g.,
\texttt{class\ Foo\ \{\ int\ Bar(char\ c)\ const;\ \};}).

Easier for people to understand how variables are being used. Allows the
compiler to do better type checking, and, conceivably, generate better
code. Helps people convince themselves of program correctness because
they know the functions they call are limited in how they can modify
your variables. Helps people know what functions are safe to use without
locks in multi-threaded programs.

\texttt{const} is viral: if you pass a \texttt{const} variable to a
function, that function must have \texttt{const} in its prototype (or
the variable will need a \texttt{const\_cast}). This can be a particular
problem when calling library functions.

We strongly recommend using \texttt{const} in APIs (i.e., on function
parameters, methods, and non-local variables) wherever it is meaningful
and accurate. This provides consistent, mostly compiler-verified
documentation of what objects an operation can mutate. Having a
consistent and reliable way to distinguish reads from writes is critical
to writing thread-safe code, and is useful in many other contexts as
well. In particular:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If a function guarantees that it will not modify an argument passed by
  reference or by pointer, the corresponding function parameter should
  be a reference-to-const (\texttt{const\ T\&}) or pointer-to-const
  (\texttt{const\ T*}), respectively.
\item
  For a function parameter passed by value, \texttt{const} has no effect
  on the caller, thus is not recommended in function declarations. See
  \href{https://abseil.io/tips/109}{TotW \#109}.
\item
  Declare methods to be \texttt{const} unless they alter the logical
  state of the object (or enable the user to modify that state, e.g., by
  returning a non-const reference, but that's rare), or they can't
  safely be invoked concurrently.
\end{itemize}

Using \texttt{const} on local variables is neither encouraged nor
discouraged.

All of a class's \texttt{const} operations should be safe to invoke
concurrently with each other. If that's not feasible, the class must be
clearly documented as ``thread-unsafe''.

\hypertarget{where-to-put-the-const}{%
\subsection{Where to put the const}\label{where-to-put-the-const}}

Some people favor the form \texttt{int\ const\ *foo} to
\texttt{const\ int*\ foo}. They argue that this is more readable because
it's more consistent: it keeps the rule that \texttt{const} always
follows the object it's describing. However, this consistency argument
doesn't apply in codebases with few deeply-nested pointer expressions
since most \texttt{const} expressions have only one \texttt{const}, and
it applies to the underlying value. In such cases, there's no
consistency to maintain. Putting the \texttt{const} first is arguably
more readable, since it follows English in putting the ``adjective''
(\texttt{const}) before the ``noun'' (\texttt{int}).

That said, while we encourage putting \texttt{const} first, we do not
require it. But be consistent with the code around you!

\hypertarget{use-of-constexpr}{%
\subsection{Use of constexpr}\label{use-of-constexpr}}

Use \texttt{constexpr} to define true constants or to ensure constant
initialization.

Some variables can be declared \texttt{constexpr} to indicate the
variables are true constants, i.e., fixed at compilation/link time. Some
functions and constructors can be declared \texttt{constexpr} which
enables them to be used in defining a \texttt{constexpr} variable.

Use of \texttt{constexpr} enables definition of constants with
floating-point expressions rather than just literals; definition of
constants of user-defined types; and definition of constants with
function calls.

Prematurely marking something as constexpr may cause migration problems
if later on it has to be downgraded. Current restrictions on what is
allowed in constexpr functions and constructors may invite obscure
workarounds in these definitions.

\texttt{constexpr} definitions enable a more robust specification of the
constant parts of an interface. Use \texttt{constexpr} to specify true
constants and the functions that support their definitions. Avoid
complexifying function definitions to enable their use with
\texttt{constexpr}. Do not use \texttt{constexpr} to force inlining.

\hypertarget{integer-types}{%
\subsection{Integer Types}\label{integer-types}}

Of the built-in C++ integer types, the only one used is \texttt{int}. If
a program needs a variable of a different size, use a precise-width
integer type from \texttt{\textless{}stdint.h\textgreater{}}, such as
\texttt{int16\_t}. If your variable represents a value that could ever
be greater than or equal to 2\^{}31 (2GiB), use a 64-bit type such as
\texttt{int64\_t}. Keep in mind that even if your value won't ever be
too large for an \texttt{int}, it may be used in intermediate
calculations which may require a larger type. When in doubt, choose a
larger type.

C++ does not specify the sizes of integer types like \texttt{int}.
Typically people assume that \texttt{short} is 16 bits, \texttt{int} is
32 bits, \texttt{long} is 32 bits and \texttt{long\ long} is 64 bits.

Uniformity of declaration.

The sizes of integral types in C++ can vary based on compiler and
architecture.

\texttt{\textless{}cstdint\textgreater{}} defines types like
\texttt{int16\_t}, \texttt{uint32\_t}, \texttt{int64\_t}, etc. You
should always use those in preference to \texttt{short},
\texttt{unsigned\ long\ long} and the like, when you need a guarantee on
the size of an integer. Of the C integer types, only \texttt{int} should
be used. When appropriate, you are welcome to use standard types like
\texttt{size\_t} and \texttt{ptrdiff\_t}.

We use \texttt{int} very often, for integers we know are not going to be
too big, e.g., loop counters. Use plain old \texttt{int} for such
things. You should assume that an \texttt{int} is at least 32 bits, but
don't assume that it has more than 32 bits. If you need a 64-bit integer
type, use \texttt{int64\_t} or \texttt{uint64\_t}.

For integers we know can be ``big'', use \texttt{int64\_t}.

You should not use the unsigned integer types such as
\texttt{uint32\_t}, unless there is a valid reason such as representing
a bit pattern rather than a number, or you need defined overflow modulo
2\^{}N. In particular, do not use unsigned types to say a number will
never be negative. Instead, use assertions for this.

If your code is a container that returns a size, be sure to use a type
that will accommodate any possible usage of your container. When in
doubt, use a larger type rather than a smaller type.

Use care when converting integer types. Integer conversions and
promotions can cause undefined behavior, leading to security bugs and
other problems.

\hypertarget{on-unsigned-integers}{%
\subsection{On Unsigned Integers}\label{on-unsigned-integers}}

Unsigned integers are good for representing bitfields and modular
arithmetic. Because of historical accident, the C++ standard also uses
unsigned integers to represent the size of containers - many members of
the standards body believe this to be a mistake, but it is effectively
impossible to fix at this point. The fact that unsigned arithmetic
doesn't model the behavior of a simple integer, but is instead defined
by the standard to model modular arithmetic (wrapping around on
overflow/underflow), means that a significant class of bugs cannot be
diagnosed by the compiler. In other cases, the defined behavior impedes
optimization.

That said, mixing signedness of integer types is responsible for an
equally large class of problems. The best advice we can provide: try to
use iterators and containers rather than pointers and sizes, try not to
mix signedness, and try to avoid unsigned types (except for representing
bitfields or modular arithmetic). Do not use an unsigned type merely to
assert that a variable is non-negative.

\hypertarget{bit-portability}{%
\subsection{64-bit Portability}\label{bit-portability}}

Code should be 64-bit and 32-bit friendly. Bear in mind problems of
printing, comparisons, and structure alignment.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Correct portable \texttt{printf()} conversion specifiers for some
  integral typedefs rely on macro expansions that we find unpleasant to
  use and impractical to require (the \texttt{PRI} macros from
  \texttt{\textless{}cinttypes\textgreater{}}). Unless there is no
  reasonable alternative for your particular case, try to avoid or even
  upgrade APIs that rely on the \texttt{printf} family. Instead use a
  library supporting typesafe numeric formatting, such as
  \href{https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/strings/str_cat.h}{\texttt{StrCat}}
  or
  \href{https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/strings/substitute.h}{\texttt{Substitute}}
  for fast simple conversions, or
  \protect\hyperlink{Streams}{\texttt{std::ostream}}.

  Unfortunately, the \texttt{PRI} macros are the only portable way to
  specify a conversion for the standard bitwidth typedefs (e.g.,
  \texttt{int64\_t}, \texttt{uint64\_t}, \texttt{int32\_t},
  \texttt{uint32\_t}, etc). Where possible, avoid passing arguments of
  types specified by bitwidth typedefs to \texttt{printf}-based APIs.
  Note that it is acceptable to use typedefs for which printf has
  dedicated length modifiers, such as \texttt{size\_t} (\texttt{z}),
  \texttt{ptrdiff\_t} (\texttt{t}), and \texttt{maxint\_t} (\texttt{j}).
\item
  Remember that \texttt{sizeof(void\ *)} != \texttt{sizeof(int)}. Use
  \texttt{intptr\_t} if you want a pointer-sized integer.
\item
  You may need to be careful with structure alignments, particularly for
  structures being stored on disk. Any class/structure with a
  \texttt{int64\_t}/\texttt{uint64\_t} member will by default end up
  being 8-byte aligned on a 64-bit system. If you have such structures
  being shared on disk between 32-bit and 64-bit code, you will need to
  ensure that they are packed the same on both architectures. Most
  compilers offer a way to alter structure alignment. For gcc, you can
  use \texttt{\_\_attribute\_\_((packed))}. MSVC offers
  \texttt{\#pragma\ pack()} and \texttt{\_\_declspec(align())}.
\item
  Use \protect\hyperlink{Casting}{braced-initialization} as needed to
  create 64-bit constants. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int64\_t}\NormalTok{ my\_value\{}\BaseNTok{0x123456789}\NormalTok{\};}
\DataTypeTok{uint64\_t}\NormalTok{ my\_mask\{}\DecValTok{3}\BuiltInTok{ULL}\NormalTok{ \textless{}\textless{} }\DecValTok{48}\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{preprocessor-macros}{%
\subsection{Preprocessor Macros}\label{preprocessor-macros}}

Avoid defining macros, especially in headers; prefer inline functions,
enums, and \texttt{const} variables. Name macros with a project-specific
prefix. Do not use macros to define pieces of a C++ API.

Macros mean that the code you see is not the same as the code the
compiler sees. This can introduce unexpected behavior, especially since
macros have global scope.

The problems introduced by macros are especially severe when they are
used to define pieces of a C++ API, and still more so for public APIs.
Every error message from the compiler when developers incorrectly use
that interface now must explain how the macros formed the interface.
Refactoring and analysis tools have a dramatically harder time updating
the interface. As a consequence, we specifically disallow using macros
in this way. For example, avoid patterns like:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ WOMBAT\_TYPE(Foo) \{}
  \CommentTok{// ...}

 \KeywordTok{public}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{  EXPAND\_PUBLIC\_WOMBAT\_API(Foo)}

\NormalTok{  EXPAND\_WOMBAT\_COMPARISONS(Foo, ==, \textless{})}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Luckily, macros are not nearly as necessary in C++ as they are in C.
Instead of using a macro to inline performance-critical code, use an
inline function. Instead of using a macro to store a constant, use a
\texttt{const} variable. Instead of using a macro to ``abbreviate'' a
long variable name, use a reference. Instead of using a macro to
conditionally compile code \ldots{} well, don't do that at all (except,
of course, for the \texttt{\#define} guards to prevent double inclusion
of header files). It makes testing much more difficult.

Macros can do things these other techniques cannot, and you do see them
in the codebase, especially in the lower-level libraries. And some of
their special features (like stringifying, concatenation, and so forth)
are not available through the language proper. But before using a macro,
consider carefully whether there's a non-macro way to achieve the same
result. If you need to use a macro to define an interface, contact your
project leads to request a waiver of this rule.

The following usage pattern will avoid many problems with macros; if you
use macros, follow it whenever possible:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Don't define macros in a \texttt{.h} file.
\item
  \texttt{\#define} macros right before you use them, and
  \texttt{\#undef} them right after.
\item
  Do not just \texttt{\#undef} an existing macro before replacing it
  with your own; instead, pick a name that's likely to be unique.
\item
  Try not to use macros that expand to unbalanced C++ constructs, or at
  least document that behavior well.
\item
  Prefer not using \texttt{\#\#} to generate function/class/variable
  names.
\end{itemize}

Exporting macros from headers (i.e., defining them in a header without
\texttt{\#undef}ing them before the end of the header) is extremely
strongly discouraged. If you do export a macro from a header, it must
have a globally unique name. To achieve this, it must be named with a
prefix consisting of your project's namespace name (but upper case).

\hypertarget{and-nullptrnull}{%
\subsection{0 and nullptr/NULL}\label{and-nullptrnull}}

Use \texttt{nullptr} for pointers, and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}0\textquotesingle{}} for chars
(and not the \texttt{0} literal).

For pointers (address values), use \texttt{nullptr}, as this provides
type-safety.

For C++03 projects, prefer \texttt{NULL} to \texttt{0}. While the values
are equivalent, \texttt{NULL} looks more like a pointer to the reader,
and some C++ compilers provide special definitions of \texttt{NULL}
which enable them to give useful warnings. Never use \texttt{NULL} for
numeric (integer or floating-point) values.

Use \texttt{\textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}0\textquotesingle{}} for
the null character. Using the correct type makes the code more readable.

\hypertarget{sizeof}{%
\subsection{sizeof}\label{sizeof}}

Prefer \texttt{sizeof(varname)} to \texttt{sizeof(type)}.

Use \texttt{sizeof(varname)} when you take the size of a particular
variable. \texttt{sizeof(varname)} will update appropriately if someone
changes the variable type either now or later. You may use
\texttt{sizeof(type)} for code unrelated to any particular variable,
such as code that manages an external or internal data format where a
variable of an appropriate C++ type is not convenient.

\protect\hypertarget{auto}{}{}

\hypertarget{type-deduction}{%
\subsection{Type deduction}\label{type-deduction}}

Use type deduction only if it makes the code clearer to readers who
aren't familiar with the project, or if it makes the code safer. Do not
use it merely to avoid the inconvenience of writing an explicit type.

There are several contexts in which C++ allows (or even requires) types
to be deduced by the compiler, rather than spelled out explicitly in the
code:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/template_argument_deduction}{Function
  template argument deduction} A function template can be invoked
  without explicit template arguments. The compiler deduces those
  arguments from the types of the function arguments:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{template}\NormalTok{ \textless{}}\KeywordTok{typename}\NormalTok{ T\textgreater{}}
\DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ f(T t);}

\NormalTok{f(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{);  }\CommentTok{// Invokes f\textless{}int\textgreater{}(0)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/auto}{\texttt{auto}
  variable declarations} A variable declaration can use the
  \texttt{auto} keyword in place of the type. The compiler deduces the
  type from the variable's initializer, following the same rules as
  function template argument deduction with the same initializer (so
  long as you don't use curly braces instead of parentheses).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ a = }\DecValTok{42}\NormalTok{;  }\CommentTok{// a is an int}
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{\& b = a;  }\CommentTok{// b is an int\&}
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ c = b;   }\CommentTok{// c is an int}
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ d\{}\DecValTok{42}\NormalTok{\};   }\CommentTok{// d is an int, not a std::initializer\_list\textless{}int\textgreater{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  \texttt{auto} can be qualified with \texttt{const}, and can be used as
  part of a pointer or reference type, but it can't be used as a
  template argument. A rare variant of this syntax uses
  \texttt{decltype(auto)} instead of \texttt{auto}, in which case the
  deduced type is the result of applying
  \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype}{\texttt{decltype}}
  to the initializer.
\item
  \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/function\#Return_type_deduction}{Function
  return type deduction} \texttt{auto} (and \texttt{decltype(auto)}) can
  also be used in place of a function return type. The compiler deduces
  the return type from the \texttt{return} statements in the function
  body, following the same rules as for variable declarations:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ f() \{ }\ControlFlowTok{return} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; \}  }\CommentTok{// The return type of f is int}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  \protect\hyperlink{Lambda_expressions}{Lambda expression} return types
  can be deduced in the same way, but this is triggered by omitting the
  return type, rather than by an explicit \texttt{auto}. Confusingly,
  \protect\hyperlink{trailing_return}{trailing return type} syntax for
  functions also uses \texttt{auto} in the return-type position, but
  that doesn't rely on type deduction; it's just an alternate syntax for
  an explicit return type.
\item
  \href{https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/cpp14-language\#generic-lambdas}{Generic
  lambdas} A lambda expression can use the \texttt{auto} keyword in
  place of one or more of its parameter types. This causes the lambda's
  call operator to be a function template instead of an ordinary
  function, with a separate template parameter for each \texttt{auto}
  function parameter:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Sort \textasciigrave{}vec\textasciigrave{} in decreasing order}
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](}\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ lhs, }\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ rhs) \{ }\ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ lhs \textgreater{} rhs; \});}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  \href{https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/cpp14-language\#lambda-captures}{Lambda
  init captures} Lambda captures can have explicit initializers, which
  can be used to declare wholly new variables rather than only capturing
  existing ones:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{[x = }\DecValTok{42}\NormalTok{, y = }\StringTok{"foo"}\NormalTok{] \{ ... \}  }\CommentTok{// x is an int, and y is a const char*}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  This syntax doesn't allow the type to be specified; instead, it's
  deduced using the rules for \texttt{auto} variables.
\item
  \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template_argument_deduction}{Class
  template argument deduction} See \protect\hyperlink{CTAD}{below}.
\item
  \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/structured_binding}{Structured
  bindings} When declaring a tuple, struct, or array using
  \texttt{auto}, you can specify names for the individual elements
  instead of a name for the whole object; these names are called
  ``structured bindings'', and the whole declaration is called a
  ``structured binding declaration''. This syntax provides no way of
  specifying the type of either the enclosing object or the individual
  names:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ [iter, success] = my\_map.insert(\{key, value\});}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (!success) \{}
\NormalTok{  iter{-}\textgreater{}second = value;}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  The \texttt{auto} can also be qualified with \texttt{const},
  \texttt{\&}, and \texttt{\&\&}, but note that these qualifiers
  technically apply to the anonymous tuple/struct/array, rather than the
  individual bindings. The rules that determine the types of the
  bindings are quite complex; the results tend to be unsurprising,
  except that the binding types typically won't be references even if
  the declaration declares a reference (but they will usually behave
  like references anyway).
\end{itemize}

(These summaries omit many details and caveats; see the links for
further information.)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  C++ type names can be long and cumbersome, especially when they
  involve templates or namespaces.
\item
  When a C++ type name is repeated within a single declaration or a
  small code region, the repetition may not be aiding readability.
\item
  It is sometimes safer to let the type be deduced, since that avoids
  the possibility of unintended copies or type conversions.
\end{itemize}

C++ code is usually clearer when types are explicit, especially when
type deduction would depend on information from distant parts of the
code. In expressions like:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ foo = x.add\_foo();}
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ i = y.Find(key);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

it may not be obvious what the resulting types are if the type of
\texttt{y} isn't very well known, or if \texttt{y} was declared many
lines earlier.

Programmers have to understand when type deduction will or won't produce
a reference type, or they'll get copies when they didn't mean to.

If a deduced type is used as part of an interface, then a programmer
might change its type while only intending to change its value, leading
to a more radical API change than intended.

The fundamental rule is: use type deduction only to make the code
clearer or safer, and do not use it merely to avoid the inconvenience of
writing an explicit type. When judging whether the code is clearer, keep
in mind that your readers are not necessarily on your team, or familiar
with your project, so types that you and your reviewer experience as
unnecessary clutter will very often provide useful information to
others. For example, you can assume that the return type of
\texttt{make\_unique\textless{}Foo\textgreater{}()} is obvious, but the
return type of \texttt{MyWidgetFactory()} probably isn't.

These principles apply to all forms of type deduction, but the details
vary, as described in the following sections.

\hypertarget{function-template-argument-deduction}{%
\subsection{Function template argument
deduction}\label{function-template-argument-deduction}}

Function template argument deduction is almost always OK. Type deduction
is the expected default way of interacting with function templates,
because it allows function templates to act like infinite sets of
ordinary function overloads. Consequently, function templates are almost
always designed so that template argument deduction is clear and safe,
or doesn't compile.

\hypertarget{local-variable-type-deduction}{%
\subsection{Local variable type
deduction}\label{local-variable-type-deduction}}

For local variables, you can use type deduction to make the code clearer
by eliminating type information that is obvious or irrelevant, so that
the reader can focus on the meaningful parts of the code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{unique\_ptr\textless{}WidgetWithBellsAndWhistles\textgreater{} widget\_ptr =}
\NormalTok{    absl::make\_unique\textless{}WidgetWithBellsAndWhistles\textgreater{}(arg1, arg2);}
\NormalTok{absl::flat\_hash\_map\textless{}}\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string,}
                    \BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{unique\_ptr\textless{}WidgetWithBellsAndWhistles\textgreater{}\textgreater{}::const\_iterator}
\NormalTok{    it = }\VariableTok{my\_map\_}\NormalTok{.find(key);}
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{array\textless{}}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{\textgreater{} numbers = \{}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{15}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{16}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{23}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{42}\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ widget\_ptr = absl::make\_unique\textless{}WidgetWithBellsAndWhistles\textgreater{}(arg1, arg2);}
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ it = }\VariableTok{my\_map\_}\NormalTok{.find(key);}
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{array numbers = \{}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{15}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{16}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{23}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{42}\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Types sometimes contain a mixture of useful information and boilerplate,
such as \texttt{it} in the example above: it's obvious that the type is
an iterator, and in many contexts the container type and even the key
type aren't relevant, but the type of the values is probably useful. In
such situations, it's often possible to define local variables with
explicit types that convey the relevant information:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ it = }\VariableTok{my\_map\_}\NormalTok{.find(key);}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (it != }\VariableTok{my\_map\_}\NormalTok{.end()) \{}
\NormalTok{  WidgetWithBellsAndWhistles\& widget = *it{-}\textgreater{}second;}
  \CommentTok{// Do stuff with \textasciigrave{}widget\textasciigrave{}}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If the type is a template instance, and the parameters are boilerplate
but the template itself is informative, you can use class template
argument deduction to suppress the boilerplate. However, cases where
this actually provides a meaningful benefit are quite rare. Note that
class template argument deduction is also subject to a
\protect\hyperlink{CTAD}{separate style rule}.

Do not use \texttt{decltype(auto)} if a simpler option will work,
because it's a fairly obscure feature, so it has a high cost in code
clarity.

\hypertarget{return-type-deduction}{%
\subsection{Return type deduction}\label{return-type-deduction}}

Use return type deduction (for both functions and lambdas) only if the
function body has a very small number of \texttt{return} statements, and
very little other code, because otherwise the reader may not be able to
tell at a glance what the return type is. Furthermore, use it only if
the function or lambda has a very narrow scope, because functions with
deduced return types don't define abstraction boundaries: the
implementation \emph{is} the interface. In particular, public functions
in header files should almost never have deduced return types.

\hypertarget{parameter-type-deduction}{%
\subsection{Parameter type deduction}\label{parameter-type-deduction}}

\texttt{auto} parameter types for lambdas should be used with caution,
because the actual type is determined by the code that calls the lambda,
rather than by the definition of the lambda. Consequently, an explicit
type will almost always be clearer unless the lambda is explicitly
called very close to where it's defined (so that the reader can easily
see both), or the lambda is passed to an interface so well-known that
it's obvious what arguments it will eventually be called with (e.g., the
\texttt{std::sort} example above).

\hypertarget{lambda-init-captures}{%
\subsection{Lambda init captures}\label{lambda-init-captures}}

Init captures are covered by a
\protect\hyperlink{Lambda_expressions}{more specific style rule}, which
largely supersedes the general rules for type deduction.

\hypertarget{structured-bindings}{%
\subsection{Structured bindings}\label{structured-bindings}}

Unlike other forms of type deduction, structured bindings can actually
give the reader additional information, by giving meaningful names to
the elements of a larger object. This means that a structured binding
declaration may provide a net readability improvement over an explicit
type, even in cases where \texttt{auto} would not. Structured bindings
are especially beneficial when the object is a pair or tuple (as in the
\texttt{insert} example above), because they don't have meaningful field
names to begin with, but note that you generally
\protect\hyperlink{Structs_vs._Tuples}{shouldn't use pairs or tuples}
unless a pre-existing API like \texttt{insert} forces you to.

If the object being bound is a struct, it may sometimes be helpful to
provide names that are more specific to your usage, but keep in mind
that this may also mean the names are less recognizable to your reader
than the field names. We recommend using a comment to indicate the name
of the underlying field, if it doesn't match the name of the binding,
using the same syntax as for function parameter comments:

\begin{verbatim}
auto [/*field_name1=*/ bound_name1, /*field_name2=*/ bound_name2] = ...
\end{verbatim}

As with function parameter comments, this can enable tools to detect if
you get the order of the fields wrong.

\hypertarget{class-template-argument-deduction}{%
\subsection{Class template argument
deduction}\label{class-template-argument-deduction}}

Use class template argument deduction only with templates that have
explicitly opted into supporting it.

\href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template_argument_deduction}{Class
template argument deduction} (often abbreviated ``CTAD'') occurs when a
variable is declared with a type that names a template, and the template
argument list is not provided (not even empty angle brackets):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{array a = \{}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{\};  }\CommentTok{// \textasciigrave{}a\textasciigrave{} is a std::array\textless{}int, 3\textgreater{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The compiler deduces the arguments from the initializer using the
template's ``deduction guides'', which can be explicit or implicit.

Explicit deduction guides look like function declarations with trailing
return types, except that there's no leading \texttt{auto}, and the
function name is the name of the template. For example, the above
example relies on this deduction guide for \texttt{std::array}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{namespace}\NormalTok{ std \{}
\KeywordTok{template}\NormalTok{ \textless{}}\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ T, }\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{... U\textgreater{}}
\NormalTok{array(T, U...) {-}\textgreater{} }\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{array\textless{}T, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{ + }\KeywordTok{sizeof}\NormalTok{...(U)\textgreater{};}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Constructors in a primary template (as opposed to a template
specialization) also implicitly define deduction guides.

When you declare a variable that relies on CTAD, the compiler selects a
deduction guide using the rules of constructor overload resolution, and
that guide's return type becomes the type of the variable.

CTAD can sometimes allow you to omit boilerplate from your code.

The implicit deduction guides that are generated from constructors may
have undesirable behavior, or be outright incorrect. This is
particularly problematic for constructors written before CTAD was
introduced in C++17, because the authors of those constructors had no
way of knowing about (much less fixing) any problems that their
constructors would cause for CTAD. Furthermore, adding explicit
deduction guides to fix those problems might break any existing code
that relies on the implicit deduction guides.

CTAD also suffers from many of the same drawbacks as \texttt{auto},
because they are both mechanisms for deducing all or part of a
variable's type from its initializer. CTAD does give the reader more
information than \texttt{auto}, but it also doesn't give the reader an
obvious cue that information has been omitted.

Do not use CTAD with a given template unless the template's maintainers
have opted into supporting use of CTAD by providing at least one
explicit deduction guide (all templates in the \texttt{std} namespace
are also presumed to have opted in). This should be enforced with a
compiler warning if available.

Uses of CTAD must also follow the general rules on
\protect\hyperlink{Type_deduction}{Type deduction}.

\hypertarget{designated-initializers}{%
\subsection{Designated initializers}\label{designated-initializers}}

Use designated initializers only in their C++20-compliant form.

\href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization\#Designated_initializers}{Designated
initializers} are a syntax that allows for initializing an aggregate
(``plain old struct'') by naming its fields explicitly:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
  \KeywordTok{struct}\NormalTok{ Point \{}
    \DataTypeTok{float}\NormalTok{ x = }\FloatTok{0.0}\NormalTok{;}
    \DataTypeTok{float}\NormalTok{ y = }\FloatTok{0.0}\NormalTok{;}
    \DataTypeTok{float}\NormalTok{ z = }\FloatTok{0.0}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{  \};}

\NormalTok{  Point p = \{}
\NormalTok{    .x = }\FloatTok{1.0}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{    .y = }\FloatTok{2.0}\NormalTok{,}
    \CommentTok{// z will be 0.0}
\NormalTok{  \};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The explicitly listed fields will be initialized as specified, and
others will be initialized in the same way they would be in a
traditional aggregate initialization expression like
\texttt{Point\{1.0,\ 2.0\}}.

Designated initializers can make for convenient and highly readable
aggregate expressions, especially for structs with less straightforward
ordering of fields than the \texttt{Point} example above.

While designated initializers have long been part of the C standard and
supported by C++ compilers as an extension, only recently have they made
it into the draft C++ standard. They are on track for publishing in
C++20.

The rules in the draft C++ standard are stricter than in C and compiler
extensions, requiring that the designated initializers appear in the
same order as the fields appear in the struct definition. So in the
example above it is legal according to draft C++20 to initialize
\texttt{x} and then \texttt{z}, but not \texttt{y} and then \texttt{x}.

Use designated initializers only in the form that is compatible with the
draft C++20 standard: with initializers in the same order as the
corresponding fields appear in the struct definition.

\hypertarget{lambda-expressions}{%
\subsection{Lambda expressions}\label{lambda-expressions}}

Use lambda expressions where appropriate. Prefer explicit captures when
the lambda will escape the current scope.

Lambda expressions are a concise way of creating anonymous function
objects. They're often useful when passing functions as arguments. For
example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ x, }\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ y) \{}
  \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ Weight(x) \textless{} Weight(y);}
\NormalTok{\});}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

They further allow capturing variables from the enclosing scope either
explicitly by name, or implicitly using a default capture. Explicit
captures require each variable to be listed, as either a value or
reference capture:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ weight = }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{;}
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ sum = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{;}
\CommentTok{// Captures \textasciigrave{}weight\textasciigrave{} by value and \textasciigrave{}sum\textasciigrave{} by reference.}
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{for\_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [weight, \&sum](}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ x) \{}
\NormalTok{  sum += weight * x;}
\NormalTok{\});}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Default captures implicitly capture any variable referenced in the
lambda body, including \texttt{this} if any members are used:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\AttributeTok{const} \BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{vector\textless{}}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{\textgreater{} lookup\_table = ...;}
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{vector\textless{}}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{\textgreater{} indices = ...;}
\CommentTok{// Captures \textasciigrave{}lookup\_table\textasciigrave{} by reference, sorts \textasciigrave{}indices\textasciigrave{} by the value}
\CommentTok{// of the associated element in \textasciigrave{}lookup\_table\textasciigrave{}.}
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{sort(indices.begin(), indices.end(), [\&](}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ a, }\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ b) \{}
  \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ lookup\_table[a] \textless{} lookup\_table[b];}
\NormalTok{\});}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A variable capture can also have an explicit initializer, which can be
used for capturing move-only variables by value, or for other situations
not handled by ordinary reference or value captures:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{unique\_ptr\textless{}Foo\textgreater{} foo = ...;}
\NormalTok{[foo = }\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{move(foo)] () \{}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Such captures (often called ``init captures'' or ``generalized lambda
captures'') need not actually ``capture'' anything from the enclosing
scope, or even have a name from the enclosing scope; this syntax is a
fully general way to define members of a lambda object:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{[foo = }\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{vector\textless{}}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{\textgreater{}(\{}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{\})] () \{}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The type of a capture with an initializer is deduced using the same
rules as \texttt{auto}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Lambdas are much more concise than other ways of defining function
  objects to be passed to STL algorithms, which can be a readability
  improvement.
\item
  Appropriate use of default captures can remove redundancy and
  highlight important exceptions from the default.
\item
  Lambdas, \texttt{std::function}, and \texttt{std::bind} can be used in
  combination as a general purpose callback mechanism; they make it easy
  to write functions that take bound functions as arguments.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Variable capture in lambdas can be a source of dangling-pointer bugs,
  particularly if a lambda escapes the current scope.
\item
  Default captures by value can be misleading because they do not
  prevent dangling-pointer bugs. Capturing a pointer by value doesn't
  cause a deep copy, so it often has the same lifetime issues as capture
  by reference. This is especially confusing when capturing `this' by
  value, since the use of `this' is often implicit.
\item
  Captures actually declare new variables (whether or not the captures
  have initializers), but they look nothing like any other variable
  declaration syntax in C++. In particular, there's no place for the
  variable's type, or even an \texttt{auto} placeholder (although init
  captures can indicate it indirectly, e.g., with a cast). This can make
  it difficult to even recognize them as declarations.
\item
  Init captures inherently rely on
  \protect\hyperlink{Type_deduction}{type deduction}, and suffer from
  many of the same drawbacks as \texttt{auto}, with the additional
  problem that the syntax doesn't even cue the reader that deduction is
  taking place.
\item
  It's possible for use of lambdas to get out of hand; very long nested
  anonymous functions can make code harder to understand.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use lambda expressions where appropriate, with formatting as described
  \protect\hyperlink{Formatting_Lambda_Expressions}{below}.
\item
  Prefer explicit captures if the lambda may escape the current scope.
  For example, instead of:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\{}
\NormalTok{  Foo foo;}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{  executor{-}\textgreater{}Schedule([\&] \{ Frobnicate(foo); \})}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\CommentTok{// BAD! The fact that the lambda makes use of a reference to \textasciigrave{}foo\textasciigrave{} and}
\CommentTok{// possibly \textasciigrave{}this\textasciigrave{} (if \textasciigrave{}Frobnicate\textasciigrave{} is a member function) may not be}
\CommentTok{// apparent on a cursory inspection. If the lambda is invoked after}
\CommentTok{// the function returns, that would be bad, because both \textasciigrave{}foo\textasciigrave{}}
\CommentTok{// and the enclosing object could have been destroyed.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  prefer to write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\{}
\NormalTok{  Foo foo;}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{  executor{-}\textgreater{}Schedule([\&foo] \{ Frobnicate(foo); \})}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\CommentTok{// BETTER {-} The compile will fail if \textasciigrave{}Frobnicate\textasciigrave{} is a member}
\CommentTok{// function, and it\textquotesingle{}s clearer that \textasciigrave{}foo\textasciigrave{} is dangerously captured by}
\CommentTok{// reference.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Use default capture by reference ({[}\&{]}) only when the lifetime of
  the lambda is obviously shorter than any potential captures.
\item
  Use default capture by value ({[}={]}) only as a means of binding a
  few variables for a short lambda, where the set of captured variables
  is obvious at a glance. Prefer not to write long or complex lambdas
  with default capture by value.
\item
  Use captures only to actually capture variables from the enclosing
  scope. Do not use captures with initializers to introduce new names,
  or to substantially change the meaning of an existing name. Instead,
  declare a new variable in the conventional way and then capture it, or
  avoid the lambda shorthand and define a function object explicitly.
\item
  See the section on \protect\hyperlink{Type_deduction}{type deduction}
  for guidance on specifying the parameter and return types.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{template-metaprogramming}{%
\subsection{Template metaprogramming}\label{template-metaprogramming}}

Avoid complicated template programming.

Template metaprogramming refers to a family of techniques that exploit
the fact that the C++ template instantiation mechanism is Turing
complete and can be used to perform arbitrary compile-time computation
in the type domain.

Template metaprogramming allows extremely flexible interfaces that are
type safe and high performance. Facilities like
\href{https://code.google.com/p/googletest/}{Google Test},
\texttt{std::tuple}, \texttt{std::function}, and Boost.Spirit would be
impossible without it.

The techniques used in template metaprogramming are often obscure to
anyone but language experts. Code that uses templates in complicated
ways is often unreadable, and is hard to debug or maintain.

Template metaprogramming often leads to extremely poor compile time
error messages: even if an interface is simple, the complicated
implementation details become visible when the user does something
wrong.

Template metaprogramming interferes with large scale refactoring by
making the job of refactoring tools harder. First, the template code is
expanded in multiple contexts, and it's hard to verify that the
transformation makes sense in all of them. Second, some refactoring
tools work with an AST that only represents the structure of the code
after template expansion. It can be difficult to automatically work back
to the original source construct that needs to be rewritten.

Template metaprogramming sometimes allows cleaner and easier-to-use
interfaces than would be possible without it, but it's also often a
temptation to be overly clever. It's best used in a small number of low
level components where the extra maintenance burden is spread out over a
large number of uses.

Think twice before using template metaprogramming or other complicated
template techniques; think about whether the average member of your team
will be able to understand your code well enough to maintain it after
you switch to another project, or whether a non-C++ programmer or
someone casually browsing the code base will be able to understand the
error messages or trace the flow of a function they want to call. If
you're using recursive template instantiations or type lists or
metafunctions or expression templates, or relying on SFINAE or on the
\texttt{sizeof} trick for detecting function overload resolution, then
there's a good chance you've gone too far.

If you use template metaprogramming, you should expect to put
considerable effort into minimizing and isolating the complexity. You
should hide metaprogramming as an implementation detail whenever
possible, so that user-facing headers are readable, and you should make
sure that tricky code is especially well commented. You should carefully
document how the code is used, and you should say something about what
the ``generated'' code looks like. Pay extra attention to the error
messages that the compiler emits when users make mistakes. The error
messages are part of your user interface, and your code should be
tweaked as necessary so that the error messages are understandable and
actionable from a user point of view.

\hypertarget{boost}{%
\subsection{Boost}\label{boost}}

Use only approved libraries from the Boost library collection.

The \href{https://www.boost.org/}{Boost library collection} is a popular
collection of peer-reviewed, free, open-source C++ libraries.

Boost code is generally very high-quality, is widely portable, and fills
many important gaps in the C++ standard library, such as type traits and
better binders.

Some Boost libraries encourage coding practices which can hamper
readability, such as metaprogramming and other advanced template
techniques, and an excessively ``functional'' style of programming.

In order to maintain a high level of readability for all contributors
who might read and maintain code, we only allow an approved subset of
Boost features. Currently, the following libraries are permitted:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.boost.org/libs/utility/call_traits.htm}{Call Traits}
  from \texttt{boost/call\_traits.hpp}
\item
  \href{https://www.boost.org/libs/utility/compressed_pair.htm}{Compressed
  Pair} from \texttt{boost/compressed\_pair.hpp}
\item
  \href{https://www.boost.org/libs/graph/}{The Boost Graph Library
  (BGL)} from \texttt{boost/graph}, except serialization
  (\texttt{adj\_list\_serialize.hpp}) and parallel/distributed
  algorithms and data structures (\texttt{boost/graph/parallel/*} and
  \texttt{boost/graph/distributed/*}).
\item
  \href{https://www.boost.org/libs/property_map/}{Property Map} from
  \texttt{boost/property\_map}, except parallel/distributed property
  maps (\texttt{boost/property\_map/parallel/*}).
\item
  \href{https://www.boost.org/libs/iterator/}{Iterator} from
  \texttt{boost/iterator}
\item
  The part of \href{https://www.boost.org/libs/polygon/}{Polygon} that
  deals with Voronoi diagram construction and doesn't depend on the rest
  of Polygon: \texttt{boost/polygon/voronoi\_builder.hpp},
  \texttt{boost/polygon/voronoi\_diagram.hpp}, and
  \texttt{boost/polygon/voronoi\_geometry\_type.hpp}
\item

  \texttt{boost/bimap}
\item

  library}.
\item
  \href{https://www.boost.org/libs/preprocessor/}{Preprocessor} from
  \texttt{boost/preprocessor}.
\end{itemize}

We are actively considering adding other Boost features to the list, so
this list may be expanded in the future.

\hypertarget{stdhash}{%
\subsection{std::hash}\label{stdhash}}

Do not define specializations of \texttt{std::hash}.

\texttt{std::hash\textless{}T\textgreater{}} is the function object that
the C++11 hash containers use to hash keys of type \texttt{T}, unless
the user explicitly specifies a different hash function. For example,
\texttt{std::unordered\_map\textless{}int,\ std::string\textgreater{}}
is a hash map that uses \texttt{std::hash\textless{}int\textgreater{}}
to hash its keys, whereas
\texttt{std::unordered\_map\textless{}int,\ std::string,\ MyIntHash\textgreater{}}
uses \texttt{MyIntHash}.

\texttt{std::hash} is defined for all integral, floating-point, pointer,
and \texttt{enum} types, as well as some standard library types such as
\texttt{string} and \texttt{unique\_ptr}. Users can enable it to work
for their own types by defining specializations of it for those types.

\texttt{std::hash} is easy to use, and simplifies the code since you
don't have to name it explicitly. Specializing \texttt{std::hash} is the
standard way of specifying how to hash a type, so it's what outside
resources will teach, and what new engineers will expect.

\texttt{std::hash} is hard to specialize. It requires a lot of
boilerplate code, and more importantly, it combines responsibility for
identifying the hash inputs with responsibility for executing the
hashing algorithm itself. The type author has to be responsible for the
former, but the latter requires expertise that a type author usually
doesn't have, and shouldn't need. The stakes here are high because
low-quality hash functions can be security vulnerabilities, due to the
emergence of
\href{https://emboss.github.io/blog/2012/12/14/breaking-murmur-hash-flooding-dos-reloaded/}{hash
flooding attacks}.

Even for experts, \texttt{std::hash} specializations are inordinately
difficult to implement correctly for compound types, because the
implementation cannot recursively call \texttt{std::hash} on data
members. High-quality hash algorithms maintain large amounts of internal
state, and reducing that state to the \texttt{size\_t} bytes that
\texttt{std::hash} returns is usually the slowest part of the
computation, so it should not be done more than once.

Due to exactly that issue, \texttt{std::hash} does not work with
\texttt{std::pair} or \texttt{std::tuple}, and the language does not
allow us to extend it to support them.

You can use \texttt{std::hash} with the types that it supports ``out of
the box'', but do not specialize it to support additional types. If you
need a hash table with a key type that \texttt{std::hash} does not
support, consider using legacy hash containers (e.g.,
\texttt{hash\_map}) for now; they use a different default hasher, which
is unaffected by this prohibition.

If you want to use the standard hash containers anyway, you will need to
specify a custom hasher for the key type, e.g.,

\begin{verbatim}
std::unordered_map<MyKeyType, Value, MyKeyTypeHasher> my_map;
\end{verbatim}

Consult with the type's owners to see if there is an existing hasher
that you can use; otherwise work with them to provide one, or roll your
own.

We are planning to provide a hash function that can work with any type,
using a new customization mechanism that doesn't have the drawbacks of
\texttt{std::hash}.

\hypertarget{other-c-features-1}{%
\subsection{Other C++ Features}\label{other-c-features-1}}

As with \protect\hyperlink{Boost}{Boost}, some modern C++ extensions
encourage coding practices that hamper readability---for example by
removing checked redundancy (such as type names) that may be helpful to
readers, or by encouraging template metaprogramming. Other extensions
duplicate functionality available through existing mechanisms, which may
lead to confusion and conversion costs.

In addition to what's described in the rest of the style guide, the
following C++ features may not be used:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Compile-time rational numbers
  (\texttt{\textless{}ratio\textgreater{}}), because of concerns that
  it's tied to a more template-heavy interface style.
\item
  The \texttt{\textless{}cfenv\textgreater{}} and
  \texttt{\textless{}fenv.h\textgreater{}} headers, because many
  compilers do not support those features reliably.
\item
  The \texttt{\textless{}filesystem\textgreater{}} header, which does
  not have sufficient support for testing, and suffers from inherent
  security vulnerabilities.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{nonstandard-extensions}{%
\subsection{Nonstandard Extensions}\label{nonstandard-extensions}}

Nonstandard extensions to C++ may not be used unless otherwise
specified.

Compilers support various extensions that are not part of standard C++.
Such extensions include GCC's \texttt{\_\_attribute\_\_}, intrinsic
functions such as \texttt{\_\_builtin\_prefetch}, inline assembly,
\texttt{\_\_COUNTER\_\_}, \texttt{\_\_PRETTY\_FUNCTION\_\_}, compound
statement expressions (e.g.,
\texttt{foo\ =\ (\{\ int\ x;\ Bar(\&x);\ x\ \})}, variable-length arrays
and \texttt{alloca()}, and the
``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_operator}{Elvis Operator}''
\texttt{a?:b}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Nonstandard extensions may provide useful features that do not exist
  in standard C++.
\item
  Important performance guidance to the compiler can only be specified
  using extensions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Nonstandard extensions do not work in all compilers. Use of
  nonstandard extensions reduces portability of code.
\item
  Even if they are supported in all targeted compilers, the extensions
  are often not well-specified, and there may be subtle behavior
  differences between compilers.
\item
  Nonstandard extensions add to the language features that a reader must
  know to understand the code.
\end{itemize}

Do not use nonstandard extensions. You may use portability wrappers that
are implemented using nonstandard extensions, so long as those wrappers
are provided by a designated project-wide portability header.

\hypertarget{aliases}{%
\subsection{Aliases}\label{aliases}}

Public aliases are for the benefit of an API's user, and should be
clearly documented.

There are several ways to create names that are aliases of other
entities:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{typedef}\NormalTok{ Foo Bar;}
\KeywordTok{using}\NormalTok{ Bar = Foo;}
\KeywordTok{using}\NormalTok{ other\_namespace::Foo;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In new code, \texttt{using} is preferable to \texttt{typedef}, because
it provides a more consistent syntax with the rest of C++ and works with
templates.

Like other declarations, aliases declared in a header file are part of
that header's public API unless they're in a function definition, in the
private portion of a class, or in an explicitly-marked internal
namespace. Aliases in such areas or in .cc files are implementation
details (because client code can't refer to them), and are not
restricted by this rule.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Aliases can improve readability by simplifying a long or complicated
  name.
\item
  Aliases can reduce duplication by naming in one place a type used
  repeatedly in an API, which \emph{might} make it easier to change the
  type later.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When placed in a header where client code can refer to them, aliases
  increase the number of entities in that header's API, increasing its
  complexity.
\item
  Clients can easily rely on unintended details of public aliases,
  making changes difficult.
\item
  It can be tempting to create a public alias that is only intended for
  use in the implementation, without considering its impact on the API,
  or on maintainability.
\item
  Aliases can create risk of name collisions
\item
  Aliases can reduce readability by giving a familiar construct an
  unfamiliar name
\item
  Type aliases can create an unclear API contract: it is unclear whether
  the alias is guaranteed to be identical to the type it aliases, to
  have the same API, or only to be usable in specified narrow ways
\end{itemize}

Don't put an alias in your public API just to save typing in the
implementation; do so only if you intend it to be used by your clients.

When defining a public alias, document the intent of the new name,
including whether it is guaranteed to always be the same as the type
it's currently aliased to, or whether a more limited compatibility is
intended. This lets the user know whether they can treat the types as
substitutable or whether more specific rules must be followed, and can
help the implementation retain some degree of freedom to change the
alias.

Don't put namespace aliases in your public API. (See also
\protect\hyperlink{Namespaces}{Namespaces}).

For example, these aliases document how they are intended to be used in
client code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{namespace}\NormalTok{ mynamespace \{}
\CommentTok{// Used to store field measurements. DataPoint may change from Bar* to some internal type.}
\CommentTok{// Client code should treat it as an opaque pointer.}
\KeywordTok{using}\NormalTok{ DataPoint = foo::Bar*;}

\CommentTok{// A set of measurements. Just an alias for user convenience.}
\KeywordTok{using}\NormalTok{ TimeSeries = }\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{unordered\_set\textless{}DataPoint, }\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{hash\textless{}DataPoint\textgreater{}, DataPointComparator\textgreater{};}
\NormalTok{\}  }\CommentTok{// namespace mynamespace}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

These aliases don't document intended use, and half of them aren't meant
for client use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{namespace}\NormalTok{ mynamespace \{}
\CommentTok{// Bad: none of these say how they should be used.}
\KeywordTok{using}\NormalTok{ DataPoint = ::foo::Bar*;}
\KeywordTok{using}\NormalTok{ ::}\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{unordered\_set;  }\CommentTok{// Bad: just for local convenience}
\KeywordTok{using}\NormalTok{ ::}\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{hash;           }\CommentTok{// Bad: just for local convenience}
\KeywordTok{typedef}\NormalTok{ unordered\_set\textless{}DataPoint, hash\textless{}DataPoint\textgreater{}, DataPointComparator\textgreater{} TimeSeries;}
\NormalTok{\}  }\CommentTok{// namespace mynamespace}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, local convenience aliases are fine in function definitions,
private sections of classes, explicitly marked internal namespaces, and
in .cc files:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// In a .cc file}
\KeywordTok{using}\NormalTok{ ::foo::Bar;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{naming}{%
\section{Naming}\label{naming}}

The most important consistency rules are those that govern naming. The
style of a name immediately informs us what sort of thing the named
entity is: a type, a variable, a function, a constant, a macro, etc.,
without requiring us to search for the declaration of that entity. The
pattern-matching engine in our brains relies a great deal on these
naming rules.

Naming rules are pretty arbitrary, but we feel that consistency is more
important than individual preferences in this area, so regardless of
whether you find them sensible or not, the rules are the rules.

\hypertarget{general-naming-rules}{%
\subsection{General Naming Rules}\label{general-naming-rules}}

Optimize for readability using names that would be clear even to people
on a different team.

Use names that describe the purpose or intent of the object. Do not
worry about saving horizontal space as it is far more important to make
your code immediately understandable by a new reader. Minimize the use
of abbreviations that would likely be unknown to someone outside your
project (especially acronyms and initialisms). Do not abbreviate by
deleting letters within a word. As a rule of thumb, an abbreviation is
probably OK if it's listed in Wikipedia. Generally speaking,
descriptiveness should be proportional to the name's scope of
visibility. For example, \texttt{n} may be a fine name within a 5-line
function, but within the scope of a class, it's likely too vague.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ MyClass \{}
 \KeywordTok{public}\NormalTok{:}
  \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ CountFooErrors(}\AttributeTok{const} \BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{vector\textless{}Foo\textgreater{}\& foos) \{}
    \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ n = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{;  }\CommentTok{// Clear meaning given limited scope and context}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ (}\AttributeTok{const} \KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{\& foo : foos) \{}
\NormalTok{      ...}
\NormalTok{      ++n;}
\NormalTok{    \}}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ n;}
\NormalTok{  \}}
  \DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ DoSomethingImportant() \{}
    \BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string fqdn = ...;  }\CommentTok{// Well{-}known abbreviation for Fully Qualified Domain Name}
\NormalTok{  \}}
 \KeywordTok{private}\NormalTok{:}
  \AttributeTok{const} \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ kMaxAllowedConnections = ...;  }\CommentTok{// Clear meaning within context}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ MyClass \{}
 \KeywordTok{public}\NormalTok{:}
  \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ CountFooErrors(}\AttributeTok{const} \BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{vector\textless{}Foo\textgreater{}\& foos) \{}
    \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ total\_number\_of\_foo\_errors = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{;  }\CommentTok{// Overly verbose given limited scope and context}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ (}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ foo\_index = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; foo\_index \textless{} foos.size(); ++foo\_index) \{  }\CommentTok{// Use idiomatic \textasciigrave{}i\textasciigrave{}}
\NormalTok{      ...}
\NormalTok{      ++total\_number\_of\_foo\_errors;}
\NormalTok{    \}}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ total\_number\_of\_foo\_errors;}
\NormalTok{  \}}
  \DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ DoSomethingImportant() \{}
    \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ cstmr\_id = ...;  }\CommentTok{// Deletes internal letters}
\NormalTok{  \}}
 \KeywordTok{private}\NormalTok{:}
  \AttributeTok{const} \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ kNum = ...;  }\CommentTok{// Unclear meaning within broad scope}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that certain universally-known abbreviations are OK, such as
\texttt{i} for an iteration variable and \texttt{T} for a template
parameter.

For the purposes of the naming rules below, a ``word'' is anything that
you would write in English without internal spaces. This includes
abbreviations, such as acronyms and initialisms. For names written in
mixed case (also sometimes referred to as
``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case}{camel case}'' or
``\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pascal_case}{Pascal case}''), in
which the first letter of each word is capitalized, prefer to capitalize
abbreviations as single words, e.g., \texttt{StartRpc()} rather than
\texttt{StartRPC()}.

Template parameters should follow the naming style for their category:
type template parameters should follow the rules for
\protect\hyperlink{Type_Names}{type names}, and non-type template
parameters should follow the rules for
\protect\hyperlink{Variable_Names}{variable names}.

\hypertarget{file-names}{%
\subsection{File Names}\label{file-names}}

Filenames should be all lowercase and can include underscores
(\texttt{\_}) or dashes (\texttt{-}). Follow the convention that your
project uses. If there is no consistent local pattern to follow, prefer
``\_''.

Examples of acceptable file names:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{my\_useful\_class.cc}
\item
  \texttt{my-useful-class.cc}
\item
  \texttt{myusefulclass.cc}
\item
  \texttt{myusefulclass\_test.cc\ //\ \_unittest\ and\ \_regtest\ are\ deprecated.}
\end{itemize}

C++ files should end in \texttt{.cc} and header files should end in
\texttt{.h}. Files that rely on being textually included at specific
points should end in \texttt{.inc} (see also the section on
\protect\hyperlink{Self_contained_Headers}{self-contained headers}).

Do not use filenames that already exist in \texttt{/usr/include}, such
as \texttt{db.h}.

In general, make your filenames very specific. For example, use
\texttt{http\_server\_logs.h} rather than \texttt{logs.h}. A very common
case is to have a pair of files called, e.g., \texttt{foo\_bar.h} and
\texttt{foo\_bar.cc}, defining a class called \texttt{FooBar}.

\hypertarget{type-names}{%
\subsection{Type Names}\label{type-names}}

Type names start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for
each new word, with no underscores: \texttt{MyExcitingClass},
\texttt{MyExcitingEnum}.

The names of all types --- classes, structs, type aliases, enums, and
type template parameters --- have the same naming convention. Type names
should start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each
new word. No underscores. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// classes and structs}
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ UrlTable \{ ...}
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ UrlTableTester \{ ...}
\KeywordTok{struct}\NormalTok{ UrlTableProperties \{ ...}

\CommentTok{// typedefs}
\KeywordTok{typedef}\NormalTok{ hash\_map\textless{}UrlTableProperties *, }\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string\textgreater{} PropertiesMap;}

\CommentTok{// using aliases}
\KeywordTok{using}\NormalTok{ PropertiesMap = hash\_map\textless{}UrlTableProperties *, }\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string\textgreater{};}

\CommentTok{// enums}
\KeywordTok{enum} \KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ UrlTableError \{ ...}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{variable-names}{%
\subsection{Variable Names}\label{variable-names}}

The names of variables (including function parameters) and data members
are all lowercase, with underscores between words. Data members of
classes (but not structs) additionally have trailing underscores. For
instance: \texttt{a\_local\_variable}, \texttt{a\_struct\_data\_member},
\texttt{a\_class\_data\_member\_}.

\hypertarget{common-variable-names}{%
\subsection{Common Variable names}\label{common-variable-names}}

For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string table\_name;  }\CommentTok{// OK {-} lowercase with underscore.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string tableName;   }\CommentTok{// Bad {-} mixed case.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{class-data-members}{%
\subsection{Class Data Members}\label{class-data-members}}

Data members of classes, both static and non-static, are named like
ordinary nonmember variables, but with a trailing underscore.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ TableInfo \{}
\NormalTok{  ...}
 \KeywordTok{private}\NormalTok{:}
  \BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string }\VariableTok{table\_name\_}\NormalTok{;  }\CommentTok{// OK {-} underscore at end.}
  \AttributeTok{static}\NormalTok{ Pool\textless{}TableInfo\textgreater{}* }\VariableTok{pool\_}\NormalTok{;  }\CommentTok{// OK.}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{struct-data-members}{%
\subsection{Struct Data Members}\label{struct-data-members}}

Data members of structs, both static and non-static, are named like
ordinary nonmember variables. They do not have the trailing underscores
that data members in classes have.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{struct}\NormalTok{ UrlTableProperties \{}
  \BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string name;}
  \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ num\_entries;}
  \AttributeTok{static}\NormalTok{ Pool\textless{}UrlTableProperties\textgreater{}* pool;}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

See \protect\hyperlink{Structs_vs._Classes}{Structs vs.~Classes} for a
discussion of when to use a struct versus a class.

\hypertarget{constant-names}{%
\subsection{Constant Names}\label{constant-names}}

Variables declared constexpr or const, and whose value is fixed for the
duration of the program, are named with a leading ``k'' followed by
mixed case. Underscores can be used as separators in the rare cases
where capitalization cannot be used for separation. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\AttributeTok{const} \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ kDaysInAWeek = }\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{;}
\AttributeTok{const} \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ kAndroid8\_0\_0 = }\DecValTok{24}\NormalTok{;  }\CommentTok{// Android 8.0.0}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

All such variables with static storage duration (i.e., statics and
globals, see
\href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration\#Storage_duration}{Storage
Duration} for details) should be named this way. This convention is
optional for variables of other storage classes, e.g., automatic
variables, otherwise the usual variable naming rules apply.

\hypertarget{function-names}{%
\subsection{Function Names}\label{function-names}}

Regular functions have mixed case; accessors and mutators may be named
like variables.

Ordinarily, functions should start with a capital letter and have a
capital letter for each new word.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{AddTableEntry()}
\NormalTok{DeleteUrl()}
\NormalTok{OpenFileOrDie()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

(The same naming rule applies to class- and namespace-scope constants
that are exposed as part of an API and that are intended to look like
functions, because the fact that they're objects rather than functions
is an unimportant implementation detail.)

Accessors and mutators (get and set functions) may be named like
variables. These often correspond to actual member variables, but this
is not required. For example, \texttt{int\ count()} and
\texttt{void\ set\_count(int\ count)}.

\hypertarget{namespace-names}{%
\subsection{Namespace Names}\label{namespace-names}}

Namespace names are all lower-case. Top-level namespace names are based
on the project name . Avoid collisions between nested namespaces and
well-known top-level namespaces.

The name of a top-level namespace should usually be the name of the
project or team whose code is contained in that namespace. The code in
that namespace should usually be in a directory whose basename matches
the namespace name (or in subdirectories thereof).

Keep in mind that the \protect\hyperlink{General_Naming_Rules}{rule
against abbreviated names} applies to namespaces just as much as
variable names. Code inside the namespace seldom needs to mention the
namespace name, so there's usually no particular need for abbreviation
anyway.

Avoid nested namespaces that match well-known top-level namespaces.
Collisions between namespace names can lead to surprising build breaks
because of name lookup rules. In particular, do not create any nested
\texttt{std} namespaces. Prefer unique project identifiers
(\texttt{websearch::index}, \texttt{websearch::index\_util}) over
collision-prone names like \texttt{websearch::util}.

For \texttt{internal} namespaces, be wary of other code being added to
the same \texttt{internal} namespace causing a collision (internal
helpers within a team tend to be related and may lead to collisions). In
such a situation, using the filename to make a unique internal name is
helpful (\texttt{websearch::index::frobber\_internal} for use in
\texttt{frobber.h})

\hypertarget{enumerator-names}{%
\subsection{Enumerator Names}\label{enumerator-names}}

Enumerators (for both scoped and unscoped enums) should be named like
\protect\hyperlink{Constant_Names}{constants}, not like
\protect\hyperlink{Macro_Names}{macros}. That is, use \texttt{kEnumName}
not \texttt{ENUM\_NAME}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{enum} \KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ UrlTableError \{}
\NormalTok{  kOk = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{  kOutOfMemory,}
\NormalTok{  kMalformedInput,}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{enum} \KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ AlternateUrlTableError \{}
\NormalTok{  OK = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{  OUT\_OF\_MEMORY = }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{  MALFORMED\_INPUT = }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Until January 2009, the style was to name enum values like
\protect\hyperlink{Macro_Names}{macros}. This caused problems with name
collisions between enum values and macros. Hence, the change to prefer
constant-style naming was put in place. New code should use
constant-style naming.

\hypertarget{macro-names}{%
\subsection{Macro Names}\label{macro-names}}

You're not really going to
\protect\hyperlink{Preprocessor_Macros}{define a macro}, are you? If you
do, they're like this:
\texttt{MY\_MACRO\_THAT\_SCARES\_SMALL\_CHILDREN\_AND\_ADULTS\_ALIKE}.

Please see the \protect\hyperlink{Preprocessor_Macros}{description of
macros}; in general macros should \emph{not} be used. However, if they
are absolutely needed, then they should be named with all capitals and
underscores.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{comments}{%
\section{Comments}\label{comments}}

Comments are absolutely vital to keeping our code readable. The
following rules describe what you should comment and where. But
remember: while comments are very important, the best code is
self-documenting. Giving sensible names to types and variables is much
better than using obscure names that you must then explain through
comments.

When writing your comments, write for your audience: the next
contributor who will need to understand your code. Be generous --- the
next one may be you!

\hypertarget{comment-style}{%
\subsection{Comment Style}\label{comment-style}}

Use either the \texttt{//} or \texttt{/*\ */} syntax, as long as you are
consistent.

You can use either the \texttt{//} or the \texttt{/*\ */} syntax;
however, \texttt{//} is \emph{much} more common. Be consistent with how
you comment and what style you use where.

\hypertarget{file-comments}{%
\subsection{File Comments}\label{file-comments}}

Start each file with license boilerplate.

File comments describe the contents of a file. If a file declares,
implements, or tests exactly one abstraction that is documented by a
comment at the point of declaration, file comments are not required. All
other files must have file comments.

\hypertarget{legal-notice-and-author-line}{%
\subsection{Legal Notice and Author
Line}\label{legal-notice-and-author-line}}

Every file should contain license boilerplate. Choose the appropriate
boilerplate for the license used by the project (for example, Apache
2.0, BSD, LGPL, GPL).

If you make significant changes to a file with an author line, consider
deleting the author line. New files should usually not contain copyright
notice or author line.

\hypertarget{file-contents}{%
\subsection{File Contents}\label{file-contents}}

If a \texttt{.h} declares multiple abstractions, the file-level comment
should broadly describe the contents of the file, and how the
abstractions are related. A 1 or 2 sentence file-level comment may be
sufficient. The detailed documentation about individual abstractions
belongs with those abstractions, not at the file level.

Do not duplicate comments in both the \texttt{.h} and the \texttt{.cc}.
Duplicated comments diverge.

\hypertarget{class-comments}{%
\subsection{Class Comments}\label{class-comments}}

Every non-obvious class or struct declaration should have an
accompanying comment that describes what it is for and how it should be
used.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Iterates over the contents of a GargantuanTable.}
\CommentTok{// Example:}
\CommentTok{//    GargantuanTableIterator* iter = table{-}\textgreater{}NewIterator();}
\CommentTok{//    for (iter{-}\textgreater{}Seek("foo"); !iter{-}\textgreater{}done(); iter{-}\textgreater{}Next()) \{}
\CommentTok{//      process(iter{-}\textgreater{}key(), iter{-}\textgreater{}value());}
\CommentTok{//    \}}
\CommentTok{//    delete iter;}
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ GargantuanTableIterator \{}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The class comment should provide the reader with enough information to
know how and when to use the class, as well as any additional
considerations necessary to correctly use the class. Document the
synchronization assumptions the class makes, if any. If an instance of
the class can be accessed by multiple threads, take extra care to
document the rules and invariants surrounding multithreaded use.

The class comment is often a good place for a small example code snippet
demonstrating a simple and focused usage of the class.

When sufficiently separated (e.g., \texttt{.h} and \texttt{.cc} files),
comments describing the use of the class should go together with its
interface definition; comments about the class operation and
implementation should accompany the implementation of the class's
methods.

\hypertarget{function-comments}{%
\subsection{Function Comments}\label{function-comments}}

Declaration comments describe use of the function (when it is
non-obvious); comments at the definition of a function describe
operation.

\hypertarget{function-declarations}{%
\subsection{Function Declarations}\label{function-declarations}}

Almost every function declaration should have comments immediately
preceding it that describe what the function does and how to use it.
These comments may be omitted only if the function is simple and obvious
(e.g., simple accessors for obvious properties of the class). These
comments should open with descriptive verbs in the indicative mood
(``Opens the file'') rather than verbs in the imperative (``Open the
file''). The comment describes the function; it does not tell the
function what to do. In general, these comments do not describe how the
function performs its task. Instead, that should be left to comments in
the function definition.

Types of things to mention in comments at the function declaration:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What the inputs and outputs are.
\item
  For class member functions: whether the object remembers reference
  arguments beyond the duration of the method call, and whether it will
  free them or not.
\item
  If the function allocates memory that the caller must free.
\item
  Whether any of the arguments can be a null pointer.
\item
  If there are any performance implications of how a function is used.
\item
  If the function is re-entrant. What are its synchronization
  assumptions?
\end{itemize}

Here is an example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Returns an iterator for this table.  It is the client\textquotesingle{}s}
\CommentTok{// responsibility to delete the iterator when it is done with it,}
\CommentTok{// and it must not use the iterator once the GargantuanTable object}
\CommentTok{// on which the iterator was created has been deleted.}
\CommentTok{//}
\CommentTok{// The iterator is initially positioned at the beginning of the table.}
\CommentTok{//}
\CommentTok{// This method is equivalent to:}
\CommentTok{//    Iterator* iter = table{-}\textgreater{}NewIterator();}
\CommentTok{//    iter{-}\textgreater{}Seek("");}
\CommentTok{//    return iter;}
\CommentTok{// If you are going to immediately seek to another place in the}
\CommentTok{// returned iterator, it will be faster to use NewIterator()}
\CommentTok{// and avoid the extra seek.}
\NormalTok{Iterator* GetIterator() }\AttributeTok{const}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, do not be unnecessarily verbose or state the completely
obvious.

When documenting function overrides, focus on the specifics of the
override itself, rather than repeating the comment from the overridden
function. In many of these cases, the override needs no additional
documentation and thus no comment is required.

When commenting constructors and destructors, remember that the person
reading your code knows what constructors and destructors are for, so
comments that just say something like ``destroys this object'' are not
useful. Document what constructors do with their arguments (for example,
if they take ownership of pointers), and what cleanup the destructor
does. If this is trivial, just skip the comment. It is quite common for
destructors not to have a header comment.

\hypertarget{function-definitions}{%
\subsection{Function Definitions}\label{function-definitions}}

If there is anything tricky about how a function does its job, the
function definition should have an explanatory comment. For example, in
the definition comment you might describe any coding tricks you use,
give an overview of the steps you go through, or explain why you chose
to implement the function in the way you did rather than using a viable
alternative. For instance, you might mention why it must acquire a lock
for the first half of the function but why it is not needed for the
second half.

Note you should \emph{not} just repeat the comments given with the
function declaration, in the \texttt{.h} file or wherever. It's okay to
recapitulate briefly what the function does, but the focus of the
comments should be on how it does it.

\hypertarget{variable-comments}{%
\subsection{Variable Comments}\label{variable-comments}}

In general the actual name of the variable should be descriptive enough
to give a good idea of what the variable is used for. In certain cases,
more comments are required.

\hypertarget{class-data-members-1}{%
\subsection{Class Data Members}\label{class-data-members-1}}

The purpose of each class data member (also called an instance variable
or member variable) must be clear. If there are any invariants (special
values, relationships between members, lifetime requirements) not
clearly expressed by the type and name, they must be commented. However,
if the type and name suffice (\texttt{int\ num\_events\_;}), no comment
is needed.

In particular, add comments to describe the existence and meaning of
sentinel values, such as nullptr or -1, when they are not obvious. For
example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{private}\NormalTok{:}
 \CommentTok{// Used to bounds{-}check table accesses. {-}1 means}
 \CommentTok{// that we don\textquotesingle{}t yet know how many entries the table has.}
 \DataTypeTok{int} \VariableTok{num\_total\_entries\_}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{global-variables}{%
\subsection{Global Variables}\label{global-variables}}

All global variables should have a comment describing what they are,
what they are used for, and (if unclear) why it needs to be global. For
example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// The total number of tests cases that we run through in this regression test.}
\AttributeTok{const} \DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ kNumTestCases = }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{implementation-comments}{%
\subsection{Implementation Comments}\label{implementation-comments}}

In your implementation you should have comments in tricky, non-obvious,
interesting, or important parts of your code.

\hypertarget{explanatory-comments}{%
\subsection{Explanatory Comments}\label{explanatory-comments}}

Tricky or complicated code blocks should have comments before them.
Example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Divide result by two, taking into account that x}
\CommentTok{// contains the carry from the add.}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ (}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ i = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; i \textless{} result{-}\textgreater{}size(); ++i) \{}
\NormalTok{  x = (x \textless{}\textless{} }\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{) + (*result)[i];}
\NormalTok{  (*result)[i] = x \textgreater{}\textgreater{} }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{  x \&= }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{line-end-comments}{%
\subsection{Line-end Comments}\label{line-end-comments}}

Also, lines that are non-obvious should get a comment at the end of the
line. These end-of-line comments should be separated from the code by 2
spaces. Example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// If we have enough memory, mmap the data portion too.}
\NormalTok{mmap\_budget = max\textless{}int64\textgreater{}(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, mmap\_budget {-} }\VariableTok{index\_}\NormalTok{{-}\textgreater{}length());}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (mmap\_budget \textgreater{}= }\VariableTok{data\_size\_}\NormalTok{ \&\& !MmapData(mmap\_chunk\_bytes, mlock))}
  \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{;  }\CommentTok{// Error already logged.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that there are both comments that describe what the code is doing,
and comments that mention that an error has already been logged when the
function returns.

\hypertarget{function-argument-comments}{%
\subsection{Function Argument
Comments}\label{function-argument-comments}}

When the meaning of a function argument is nonobvious, consider one of
the following remedies:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the argument is a literal constant, and the same constant is used
  in multiple function calls in a way that tacitly assumes they're the
  same, you should use a named constant to make that constraint
  explicit, and to guarantee that it holds.
\item
  Consider changing the function signature to replace a \texttt{bool}
  argument with an \texttt{enum} argument. This will make the argument
  values self-describing.
\item
  For functions that have several configuration options, consider
  defining a single class or struct to hold all the options , and pass
  an instance of that. This approach has several advantages. Options are
  referenced by name at the call site, which clarifies their meaning. It
  also reduces function argument count, which makes function calls
  easier to read and write. As an added benefit, you don't have to
  change call sites when you add another option.
\item
  Replace large or complex nested expressions with named variables.
\item
  As a last resort, use comments to clarify argument meanings at the
  call site.
\end{itemize}

Consider the following example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// What are these arguments?}
\AttributeTok{const}\NormalTok{ DecimalNumber product = CalculateProduct(values, }\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{, }\KeywordTok{false}\NormalTok{, }\KeywordTok{nullptr}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

versus:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ProductOptions options;}
\NormalTok{options.set\_precision\_decimals(}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{);}
\NormalTok{options.set\_use\_cache(ProductOptions::kDontUseCache);}
\AttributeTok{const}\NormalTok{ DecimalNumber product =}
\NormalTok{    CalculateProduct(values, options, }\CommentTok{/*completion\_callback=*/}\KeywordTok{nullptr}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{donts}{%
\subsection{Don'ts}\label{donts}}

Do not state the obvious. In particular, don't literally describe what
code does, unless the behavior is nonobvious to a reader who understands
C++ well. Instead, provide higher level comments that describe
\emph{why} the code does what it does, or make the code self describing.

Compare this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Find the element in the vector.  \textless{}{-}{-} Bad: obvious!}
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ iter = }\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{find(v.begin(), v.end(), element);}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (iter != v.end()) \{}
\NormalTok{  Process(element);}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Process "element" unless it was already processed.}
\KeywordTok{auto}\NormalTok{ iter = }\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{find(v.begin(), v.end(), element);}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (iter != v.end()) \{}
\NormalTok{  Process(element);}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Self-describing code doesn't need a comment. The comment from the
example above would be obvious:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (!IsAlreadyProcessed(element)) \{}
\NormalTok{  Process(element);}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{punctuation-spelling-and-grammar}{%
\subsection{Punctuation, Spelling, and
Grammar}\label{punctuation-spelling-and-grammar}}

Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is easier to
read well-written comments than badly written ones.

Comments should be as readable as narrative text, with proper
capitalization and punctuation. In many cases, complete sentences are
more readable than sentence fragments. Shorter comments, such as
comments at the end of a line of code, can sometimes be less formal, but
you should be consistent with your style.

Although it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point out that
you are using a comma when you should be using a semicolon, it is very
important that source code maintain a high level of clarity and
readability. Proper punctuation, spelling, and grammar help with that
goal.

\hypertarget{todo-comments}{%
\subsection{TODO Comments}\label{todo-comments}}

Use \texttt{TODO} comments for code that is temporary, a short-term
solution, or good-enough but not perfect.

\texttt{TODO}s should include the string \texttt{TODO} in all caps,
followed by the name, e-mail address, bug ID, or other identifier of the
person or issue with the best context about the problem referenced by
the \texttt{TODO}. The main purpose is to have a consistent
\texttt{TODO} that can be searched to find out how to get more details
upon request. A \texttt{TODO} is not a commitment that the person
referenced will fix the problem. Thus when you create a \texttt{TODO}
with a name, it is almost always your name that is given.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// }\AlertTok{TODO}\CommentTok{(kl@gmail.com): Use a "*" here for concatenation operator.}
\CommentTok{// }\AlertTok{TODO}\CommentTok{(Zeke) change this to use relations.}
\CommentTok{// }\AlertTok{TODO}\CommentTok{(bug 12345): remove the "Last visitors" feature.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If your \texttt{TODO} is of the form ``At a future date do something''
make sure that you either include a very specific date (``Fix by
November 2005'') or a very specific event (``Remove this code when all
clients can handle XML responses.'').

\hypertarget{formatting}{%
\section{Formatting}\label{formatting}}

Coding style and formatting are pretty arbitrary, but a project is much
easier to follow if everyone uses the same style. Individuals may not
agree with every aspect of the formatting rules, and some of the rules
may take some getting used to, but it is important that all project
contributors follow the style rules so that they can all read and
understand everyone's code easily.

To help you format code correctly, we've created a
\href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/google-c-style.el}{settings
file for emacs}.

\hypertarget{line-length}{%
\subsection{Line Length}\label{line-length}}

Each line of text in your code should be at most 80 characters long.

We recognize that this rule is controversial, but so much existing code
already adheres to it, and we feel that consistency is important.

Those who favor this rule argue that it is rude to force them to resize
their windows and there is no need for anything longer. Some folks are
used to having several code windows side-by-side, and thus don't have
room to widen their windows in any case. People set up their work
environment assuming a particular maximum window width, and 80 columns
has been the traditional standard. Why change it?

Proponents of change argue that a wider line can make code more
readable. The 80-column limit is an hidebound throwback to 1960s
mainframes; modern equipment has wide screens that can easily show
longer lines.

80 characters is the maximum.

A line may exceed 80 characters if it is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a comment line which is not feasible to split without harming
  readability, ease of cut and paste or auto-linking -- e.g., if a line
  contains an example command or a literal URL longer than 80
  characters.
\item
  a raw-string literal with content that exceeds 80 characters. Except
  for test code, such literals should appear near the top of a file.
\item
  an include statement.
\item
  a \protect\hyperlink{The__define_Guard}{header guard}
\item
  a using-declaration
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{non-ascii-characters}{%
\subsection{Non-ASCII Characters}\label{non-ascii-characters}}

Non-ASCII characters should be rare, and must use UTF-8 formatting.

You shouldn't hard-code user-facing text in source, even English, so use
of non-ASCII characters should be rare. However, in certain cases it is
appropriate to include such words in your code. For example, if your
code parses data files from foreign sources, it may be appropriate to
hard-code the non-ASCII string(s) used in those data files as
delimiters. More commonly, unittest code (which does not need to be
localized) might contain non-ASCII strings. In such cases, you should
use UTF-8, since that is an encoding understood by most tools able to
handle more than just ASCII.

Hex encoding is also OK, and encouraged where it enhances readability
--- for example,
\texttt{"\textbackslash{}xEF\textbackslash{}xBB\textbackslash{}xBF"},
or, even more simply, \texttt{u8"\textbackslash{}uFEFF"}, is the Unicode
zero-width no-break space character, which would be invisible if
included in the source as straight UTF-8.

Use the \texttt{u8} prefix to guarantee that a string literal containing
\texttt{\textbackslash{}uXXXX} escape sequences is encoded as UTF-8. Do
not use it for strings containing non-ASCII characters encoded as UTF-8,
because that will produce incorrect output if the compiler does not
interpret the source file as UTF-8.

You shouldn't use the C++11 \texttt{char16\_t} and \texttt{char32\_t}
character types, since they're for non-UTF-8 text. For similar reasons
you also shouldn't use \texttt{wchar\_t} (unless you're writing code
that interacts with the Windows API, which uses \texttt{wchar\_t}
extensively).

\hypertarget{spaces-vs.-tabs}{%
\subsection{Spaces vs.~Tabs}\label{spaces-vs.-tabs}}

Use only spaces, and indent 2 spaces at a time.

We use spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs in your code. You should
set your editor to emit spaces when you hit the tab key.

\hypertarget{function-declarations-and-definitions}{%
\subsection{Function Declarations and
Definitions}\label{function-declarations-and-definitions}}

Return type on the same line as function name, parameters on the same
line if they fit. Wrap parameter lists which do not fit on a single line
as you would wrap arguments in a
\protect\hyperlink{Function_Calls}{function call}.

Functions look like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ReturnType ClassName::FunctionName(Type par\_name1, Type par\_name2) \{}
\NormalTok{  DoSomething();}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you have too much text to fit on one line:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ReturnType ClassName::ReallyLongFunctionName(Type par\_name1, Type par\_name2,}
\NormalTok{                                             Type par\_name3) \{}
\NormalTok{  DoSomething();}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or if you cannot fit even the first parameter:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ReturnType LongClassName::ReallyReallyReallyLongFunctionName(}
\NormalTok{    Type par\_name1,  }\CommentTok{// 4 space indent}
\NormalTok{    Type par\_name2,}
\NormalTok{    Type par\_name3) \{}
\NormalTok{  DoSomething();  }\CommentTok{// 2 space indent}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Some points to note:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Choose good parameter names.
\item
  A parameter name may be omitted only if the parameter is not used in
  the function's definition.
\item
  If you cannot fit the return type and the function name on a single

Floating-point literals should always have a radix point, with digits on
both sides, even if they use exponential notation. Readability is
improved if all floating-point literals take this familiar form, as this
helps ensure that they are not mistaken for integer literals, and that
the \texttt{E}/\texttt{e} of the exponential notation is not mistaken
for a hexadecimal digit. It is fine to initialize a floating-point
variable with an integer literal (assuming the variable type can exactly
represent that integer), but note that a number in exponential notation
is never an integer literal.

\hypertarget{function-calls}{%
\subsection{Function Calls}\label{function-calls}}

Either write the call all on a single line, wrap the arguments at the
parenthesis, or start the arguments on a new line indented by four
spaces and continue at that 4 space indent. In the absence of other
considerations, use the minimum number of lines, including placing
multiple arguments on each line where appropriate.

Function calls have the following format:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{bool}\NormalTok{ result = DoSomething(argument1, argument2, argument3);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If the arguments do not all fit on one line, they should be broken up
onto multiple lines, with each subsequent line aligned with the first
argument. Do not add spaces after the open paren or before the close
paren:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{bool}\NormalTok{ result = DoSomething(averyveryveryverylongargument1,}
\NormalTok{                          argument2, argument3);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Arguments may optionally all be placed on subsequent lines with a four
space indent:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (...) \{}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{  ...}
  \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (...) \{}
    \DataTypeTok{bool}\NormalTok{ result = DoSomething(}
\NormalTok{        argument1, argument2,  }\CommentTok{// 4 space indent}
\NormalTok{        argument3, argument4);}
\NormalTok{    ...}
\NormalTok{  \}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Put multiple arguments on a single line to reduce the number of lines
necessary for calling a function unless there is a specific readability
problem. Some find that formatting with strictly one argument on each
line is more readable and simplifies editing of the arguments. However,
we prioritize for the reader over the ease of editing arguments, and
most readability problems are better addressed with the following
techniques.

If having multiple arguments in a single line decreases readability due
to the complexity or confusing nature of the expressions that make up
some arguments, try creating variables that capture those arguments in a
descriptive name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ my\_heuristic = scores[x] * y + bases[x];}
\DataTypeTok{bool}\NormalTok{ result = DoSomething(my\_heuristic, x, y, z);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Or put the confusing argument on its own line with an explanatory
comment:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{bool}\NormalTok{ result = DoSomething(scores[x] * y + bases[x],  }\CommentTok{// Score heuristic.}
\NormalTok{                          x, y, z);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If there is still a case where one argument is significantly more
readable on its own line, then put it on its own line. The decision
should be specific to the argument which is made more readable rather
than a general policy.

Sometimes arguments form a structure that is important for readability.
In those cases, feel free to format the arguments according to that
structure:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Transform the widget by a 3x3 matrix.}
\NormalTok{my\_widget.Transform(x1, x2, x3,}
\NormalTok{                    y1, y2, y3,}
\NormalTok{                    z1, z2, z3);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{braced-initializer-list-format}{%
\subsection{Braced Initializer List
Format}\label{braced-initializer-list-format}}

Format a \protect\hyperlink{Braced_Initializer_List}{braced initializer
list} exactly like you would format a function call in its place.

If the braced list follows a name (e.g., a type or variable name),
format as if the \texttt{\{\}} were the parentheses of a function call
with that name. If there is no name, assume a zero-length name.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{conditionals}{%
\subsection{Conditionals}\label{conditionals}}

The \texttt{if} and \texttt{else} keywords belong on separate lines.
There should be a space between the \texttt{if} and the open
parenthesis, and between the close parenthesis and the curly brace (if
any), but no space between the parentheses and the condition.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (condition) \{  }\CommentTok{// no spaces inside parentheses}
\NormalTok{  ...  }\CommentTok{// 2 space indent.}
\NormalTok{\} }\ControlFlowTok{else} \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (...) \{  }\CommentTok{// The else goes on the same line as the closing brace.}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\} }\ControlFlowTok{else}\NormalTok{ \{}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}

\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (condition)\{   }\CommentTok{// Bad {-} space missing before \{.}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(condition)\{    }\CommentTok{// Doubly bad.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (condition) \{  }\CommentTok{// Good {-} proper space after IF and before \{.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Short conditional statements may be written on one line if this enhances
readability. You may use this only when the line is brief and the
statement does not use the \texttt{else} clause.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (x == kFoo) }\ControlFlowTok{return} \KeywordTok{new}\NormalTok{ Foo();}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (x == kBar) }\ControlFlowTok{return} \KeywordTok{new}\NormalTok{ Bar();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This is not allowed when the if statement has an \texttt{else}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Not allowed {-} IF statement on one line when there is an ELSE clause}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (x) DoThis();}
\ControlFlowTok{else}\NormalTok{ DoThat();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In general, curly braces are not required for single-line statements,
but they are allowed if you like them; conditional or loop statements
with complex conditions or statements may be more readable with curly
braces. Some projects require that an \texttt{if} must always have an
accompanying brace.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (condition)}
\NormalTok{  DoSomething();  }\CommentTok{// 2 space indent.}

\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (condition) \{}
\NormalTok{  DoSomething();  }\CommentTok{// 2 space indent.}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, if one part of an \texttt{if}-\texttt{else} statement uses
curly braces, the other part must too:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// Not allowed {-} curly on IF but not ELSE}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (condition) \{}
\NormalTok{  foo;}
\NormalTok{\} }\ControlFlowTok{else}
\NormalTok{  bar;}

\CommentTok{// Not allowed {-} curly on ELSE but not IF}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (condition)}
\NormalTok{  foo;}
\ControlFlowTok{else}\NormalTok{ \{}
\NormalTok{  bar;}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}

\CommentTok{// one of the clauses used braces.}

\NormalTok{  bar;}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{loops-and-switch-statements}{%
\subsection{Loops and Switch
Statements}\label{loops-and-switch-statements}}

Switch statements may use braces for blocks. Annotate non-trivial
fall-through between cases. Braces are optional for single-statement
loops. Empty loop bodies should use either empty braces or
\texttt{continue}.

\texttt{case} blocks in \texttt{switch} statements can have curly braces
or not, depending on your preference. If you do include curly braces
they should be placed as shown below.

If not conditional on an enumerated value, switch statements should
always have a \texttt{default} case (in the case of an enumerated value,
the compiler will warn you if any values are not handled). If the
default case should never execute, treat this as an error. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{switch}\NormalTok{ (var) \{}
  \ControlFlowTok{case} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{: \{  }\CommentTok{// 2 space indent}
\NormalTok{    ...      }\CommentTok{// 4 space indent}
    \ControlFlowTok{break}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{  \}}
  \ControlFlowTok{case} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{: \{}
\NormalTok{    ...}
    \ControlFlowTok{break}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{  \}}
  \ControlFlowTok{default}\NormalTok{: \{}
    \OtherTok{assert}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{false}\NormalTok{);}
\NormalTok{  \}}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Fall-through from one case label to another must be annotated using the
\texttt{ABSL\_FALLTHROUGH\_INTENDED;} macro (defined in
\texttt{absl/base/macros.h}). \texttt{ABSL\_FALLTHROUGH\_INTENDED;}
should be placed at a point of execution where a fall-through to the
next case label occurs. A common exception is consecutive case labels
without intervening code, in which case no annotation is needed.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{switch}\NormalTok{ (x) \{}
  \ControlFlowTok{case} \DecValTok{41}\NormalTok{:  }\CommentTok{// No annotation needed here.}
  \ControlFlowTok{case} \DecValTok{43}\NormalTok{:}
    \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (dont\_be\_picky) \{}
      \CommentTok{// Use this instead of or along with annotations in comments.}
\NormalTok{      ABSL\_FALLTHROUGH\_INTENDED;}
\NormalTok{    \} }\ControlFlowTok{else}\NormalTok{ \{}
\NormalTok{      CloseButNoCigar();}
      \ControlFlowTok{break}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{    \}}
  \ControlFlowTok{case} \DecValTok{42}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    DoSomethingSpecial();}
\NormalTok{    ABSL\_FALLTHROUGH\_INTENDED;}
  \ControlFlowTok{default}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    DoSomethingGeneric();}
    \ControlFlowTok{break}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Braces are optional for single-statement loops.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ (}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ i = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; i \textless{} kSomeNumber; ++i)}

\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ (}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ i = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; i \textless{} kSomeNumber; ++i) \{}
\NormalTok{  printf(}\StringTok{"I take it back}\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}n}\StringTok{"}\NormalTok{);}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Empty loop bodies should use either an empty pair of braces or
\texttt{continue} with no braces, rather than a single semicolon.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{while}\NormalTok{ (condition) \{}
  \CommentTok{// Repeat test until it returns false.}

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{pointer-and-reference-expressions}{%
\subsection{Pointer and Reference
Expressions}\label{pointer-and-reference-expressions}}

No spaces around period or arrow. Pointer operators do not have trailing
spaces.

The following are examples of correctly-formatted pointer and reference
expressions:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x = *p;}
\NormalTok{p = \&x;}
\NormalTok{x = r.y;}
\NormalTok{x = r{-}\textgreater{}y;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are no spaces around the period or arrow when accessing a
  member.
\item
  Pointer operators have no space after the \texttt{*} or \texttt{\&}.
\end{itemize}

When declaring a pointer variable or argument, you may place the
asterisk adjacent to either the type or to the variable name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// These are fine, space preceding.}
\DataTypeTok{char}\NormalTok{ *c;}
\AttributeTok{const} \BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string \&str;}

\CommentTok{// These are fine, space following.}
\DataTypeTok{char}\NormalTok{* c;}
\AttributeTok{const} \BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{string\& str;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You should do this consistently within a single file, so, when modifying
an existing file, use the style in that file.

It is allowed (if unusual) to declare multiple variables in the same
declaration, but it is disallowed if any of those have pointer or
reference decorations. Such declarations are easily misread.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{boolean-expressions}{%
\subsection{Boolean Expressions}\label{boolean-expressions}}

When you have a boolean expression that is longer than the
\protect\hyperlink{Line_Length}{standard line length}, be consistent in
how you break up the lines.

In this example, the logical AND operator is always at the end of the
lines:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (this\_one\_thing \textgreater{} this\_other\_thing \&\&}
\NormalTok{    a\_third\_thing == a\_fourth\_thing \&\&}
\NormalTok{    yet\_another \&\& last\_one) \{}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that when the code wraps in this example, both of the \texttt{\&\&}
logical AND operators are at the end of the line. This is more common in
Genrep code, though wrapping all operators at the beginning of the line
is also allowed. Feel free to insert extra parentheses judiciously
because they can be very helpful in increasing readability when used
appropriately, but be careful about overuse. Also note that you should
always use the punctuation operators, such as \texttt{\&\&} and
\texttt{\textasciitilde{}}, rather than the word operators, such as
\texttt{and} and \texttt{compl}.

\hypertarget{return-values}{%
\subsection{Return Values}\label{return-values}}

Do not needlessly surround the \texttt{return} expression with
parentheses.

Be careful when using a braced initialization list \texttt{\{...\}} on a
type with an \texttt{std::initializer\_list} constructor. A nonempty
\emph{braced-init-list} prefers the \texttt{std::initializer\_list}
constructor whenever possible. Note that empty braces \texttt{\{\}} are
special, and will call a default constructor if available. To force the
non-\texttt{std::initializer\_list} constructor, use parentheses instead
of braces.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{std::}\NormalTok{vector\textless{}}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{\textgreater{} v(}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{);  }\CommentTok{// A vector containing 100 items: All 1s.}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Also, the brace form prevents narrowing of integral types. This can
prevent some types of programming errors.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{preprocessor-directives}{%
\subsection{Preprocessor Directives}\label{preprocessor-directives}}

The hash mark that starts a preprocessor directive should always be at
the beginning of the line.

Even when preprocessor directives are within the body of indented code,
the directives should start at the beginning of the line.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{class-format}{%
\subsection{Class Format}\label{class-format}}

Sections in \texttt{public}, \texttt{protected} and \texttt{private}
order, each indented one space.

The basic format for a class definition (lacking the comments, see
\protect\hyperlink{Class_Comments}{Class Comments} for a discussion of
what comments are needed) is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ MyClass : }\KeywordTok{public}\NormalTok{ OtherClass \{}
 \KeywordTok{public}\NormalTok{:      }\CommentTok{// Note the 1 space indent!}
\NormalTok{  MyClass();  }\CommentTok{// Regular 2 space indent.}
  \KeywordTok{explicit}\NormalTok{ MyClass(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ var);}
\NormalTok{  \textasciitilde{}MyClass() \{\}}

  \DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ SomeFunction();}
  \DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ SomeFunctionThatDoesNothing() \{}

  \DataTypeTok{int} \VariableTok{some\_other\_var\_}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Things to note:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Any base class name should be on the same line as the subclass name,
  subject to the 80-column limit.
\item
  The \texttt{public:}, \texttt{protected:}, and \texttt{private:}
  keywords should be indented one space.
\item
  Except for the first instance, these keywords should be preceded by a
  blank line. This rule is optional in small classes.
\item
  Do not leave a blank line after these keywords.
\item
  The \texttt{public} section should be first, followed by the
  \texttt{protected} and finally the \texttt{private} section.
\item
  See \protect\hyperlink{Declaration_Order}{Declaration Order} for rules
  on ordering declarations within each of these sections.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{constructor-initializer-lists}{%
\subsection{Constructor Initializer
Lists}\label{constructor-initializer-lists}}

Constructor initializer lists can be all on one line or with subsequent
lines indented four spaces.

The acceptable formats for initializer lists are:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// When everything fits on one line:}
\NormalTok{MyClass::MyClass(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ var) : }\VariableTok{some\_var\_}\NormalTok{(var) \{}
\NormalTok{  DoSomething();}
\NormalTok{\}}

\CommentTok{// If the signature and initializer list are not all on one line,}
\CommentTok{// you must wrap before the colon and indent 4 spaces:}

\NormalTok{    : }\VariableTok{some\_var\_}\NormalTok{(var), }\VariableTok{some\_other\_var\_}\NormalTok{(var + }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{) \{}
\NormalTok{  DoSomething();}
\NormalTok{\}}

\CommentTok{// When the list spans multiple lines, put each member on its own line}
\CommentTok{// and align them:}
\NormalTok{MyClass::MyClass(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ var)}
\NormalTok{    : }\VariableTok{some\_var\_}\NormalTok{(var),             }\CommentTok{// 4 space indent}
      \VariableTok{some\_other\_var\_}\NormalTok{(var + }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{) \{  }\CommentTok{// lined up}
\NormalTok{  DoSomething();}
\NormalTok{\}}

\CommentTok{// As with any other code block, the close curly can be on the same}
\CommentTok{// line as the open curly, if it fits.}
\NormalTok{MyClass::MyClass(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ var)}
\NormalTok{    : }\VariableTok{some\_var\_}\NormalTok{(var) \{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{namespace-formatting}{%
\subsection{Namespace Formatting}\label{namespace-formatting}}

The contents of namespaces are not indented.

\protect\hyperlink{Namespaces}{Namespaces} do not add an extra level of
indentation. For example, use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{namespace}\NormalTok{ \{}

\DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ foo() \{  }\CommentTok{// Correct.  No extra indentation within namespace.}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\NormalTok{\}}

\NormalTok{\}  }\CommentTok{// namespace}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Do not indent within a namespace:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{namespace}\NormalTok{ \{}

  \CommentTok{// Wrong!  Indented when it should not be.}
  \DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ foo() \{}
\NormalTok{    ...}
\NormalTok{  \}}

\NormalTok{\}  }\CommentTok{// namespace}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\NormalTok{  ...}
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ i = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{;  }\CommentTok{// Semicolons usually have no space before them.}
\CommentTok{// Spaces inside braces for braced{-}init{-}list are optional.  If you use them,}
\CommentTok{// put them on both sides!}
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ x[] = \{ }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{ \};}
\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ x[] = \{}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{\};}

\CommentTok{// Spaces around the colon in inheritance and initializer lists.}
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{ Foo : }\KeywordTok{public}\NormalTok{ Bar \{}
 \KeywordTok{public}\NormalTok{:}
  \CommentTok{// For inline function implementations, put spaces between the braces}
  \CommentTok{// and the implementation itself.}
\NormalTok{  Foo(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ b) : Bar(), }\VariableTok{baz\_}\NormalTok{(b) \{\}  }\CommentTok{// No spaces inside empty braces.}
  \DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{ Reset() \{ }\VariableTok{baz\_}\NormalTok{ = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; \}  }\CommentTok{// Spaces separating braces from implementation.}
\NormalTok{  ...}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Adding trailing whitespace can cause extra work for others editing the
same file, when they merge, as can removing existing trailing
whitespace. So: Don't introduce trailing whitespace. Remove it if you're
already changing that line, or do it in a separate clean-up operation
(preferably when no-one else is working on the file).

\hypertarget{vertical-whitespace}{%
\subsection{Vertical Whitespace}\label{vertical-whitespace}}

Minimize use of vertical whitespace.

This is more a principle than a rule: don't use blank lines when you
don't have to. In particular, don't put more than one or two blank lines
between functions, resist starting functions with a blank line, don't
end functions with a blank line, and be sparing with your use of blank
lines. A blank line within a block of code serves like a paragraph break
in prose: visually separating two thoughts.

The basic principle is: The more code that fits on one screen, the
easier it is to follow and understand the control flow of the program.
Use whitespace purposefully to provide separation in that flow.

Some rules of thumb to help when blank lines may be useful:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Blank lines at the beginning or end of a function do not help
  readability.
\item
  Blank lines inside a chain of if-else blocks may well help
  readability.
\item
  A blank line before a comment line usually helps readability --- the
  introduction of a new comment suggests the start of a new thought, and
  the blank line makes it clear that the comment goes with the following
  thing instead of the preceding.
\item
  Blank lines immediately inside a declaration of a namespace or block
  of namespaces may help readability by visually separating the
  load-bearing content from the (largely non-semantic) organizational
  wrapper. Especially when the first declaration inside the namespace(s)
  is preceded by a comment, this becomes a special case of the previous
  rule, helping the comment to ``attach'' to the subsequent declaration.

\section{Exceptions to the Rules}\label{exceptions-to-the-rules}}

The coding conventions described above are mandatory. However, like all
good rules, these sometimes have exceptions, which we discuss here.

\subsection{Existing Non-conformant
Code}\label{existing-non-conformant-code}}

You may diverge from the rules when dealing with code that does not
conform to this style guide.

If you find yourself modifying code that was written to specifications
other than those presented by this guide, you may have to diverge from
these rules in order to stay consistent with the local conventions in
that code. If you are in doubt about how to do this, ask the original
author or the person currently responsible for the code. Remember that
\emph{consistency} includes local consistency, too.

\hypertarget{windows-code}{%
\subsection{Windows Code}\label{windows-code}}

Windows programmers have developed their own set of coding conventions,
mainly derived from the conventions in Windows headers and other
Microsoft code. We want to make it easy for anyone to understand your
code, so we have a single set of guidelines for everyone writing C++ on
any platform.

It is worth reiterating a few of the guidelines that you might forget if
you are used to the prevalent Windows style:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do not use Hungarian notation (for example, naming an integer
  \texttt{iNum}). Use the Genrep naming conventions, including the
  \texttt{.cc} extension for source files.
\item
  Windows defines many of its own synonyms for primitive types, such as
  \texttt{DWORD}, \texttt{HANDLE}, etc. It is perfectly acceptable, and
  encouraged, that you use these types when calling Windows API
  functions. Even so, keep as close as you can to the underlying C++
  types. For example, use \texttt{const\ TCHAR\ *} instead of
  \texttt{LPCTSTR}.
\item
  When compiling with Microsoft Visual C++, set the compiler to warning
  level 3 or higher, and treat all warnings as errors.
\item
  Do not use \texttt{\#pragma\ once}; instead use the standard Genrep
  include guards. The path in the include guards should be relative to
  the top of your project tree.
\item
  In fact, do not use any nonstandard extensions, like \texttt{\#pragma}
  and \texttt{\_\_declspec}, unless you absolutely must. Using
  \texttt{\_\_declspec(dllimport)} and \texttt{\_\_declspec(dllexport)}
  is allowed; however, you must use them through macros such as
  \texttt{DLLIMPORT} and \texttt{DLLEXPORT}, so that someone can easily
  disable the extensions if they share the code.
\end{itemize}

However, there are just a few rules that we occasionally need to break
on Windows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Normally we \protect\hyperlink{Multiple_Inheritance}{strongly
  discourage the use of multiple implementation inheritance}; however,
  it is required when using COM and some ATL/WTL classes. You may use
  multiple implementation inheritance to implement COM or ATL/WTL
  classes and interfaces.
\item
  Although you should not use exceptions in your own code, they are used
  extensively in the ATL and some STLs, including the one that comes
  with Visual C++. When using the ATL, you should define
  \texttt{\_ATL\_NO\_EXCEPTIONS} to disable exceptions. You should
  investigate whether you can also disable exceptions in your STL, but
  if not, it is OK to turn on exceptions in the compiler. (Note that
  this is only to get the STL to compile. You should still not write
  exception handling code yourself.)
\item
  The usual way of working with precompiled headers is to include a
  header file at the top of each source file, typically with a name like
  \texttt{StdAfx.h} or \texttt{precompile.h}. To make your code easier
  to share with other projects, avoid including this file explicitly
  (except in \texttt{precompile.cc}), and use the \texttt{/FI} compiler
  option to include the file automatically.
\item
  Resource headers, which are usually named \texttt{resource.h} and
  contain only macros, do not need to conform to these style guidelines.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{parting-words}{%
\section{Parting Words}\label{parting-words}}

Use common sense and \emph{BE CONSISTENT}.

If you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around
you and determine its style. If they use spaces around their \texttt{if}
clauses, you should, too. If their comments have little boxes of stars
around them, make your comments have little boxes of stars around them
too.

The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of
coding so people can concentrate on what you are saying, rather than on
how you are saying it. We present global style rules here so people know
the vocabulary. But local style is also important. If code you add to a
file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, the
discontinuity throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read
it. Try to avoid this.

OK, enough writing about writing code; the code itself is much more
interesting. Have fun!
